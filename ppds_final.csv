Communiqué du CNRE n° 233
mercredi 10 mai 2023
 
Voici que le gouvernement remplaciste, c'est-à-dire le pouvoir négationniste-génocidaire, celui-là même qui, à travers l'un ou l'autre de ses bras armés, vient de faire disparaître, et pour cause, le site du Conseil National de la Résistance, reparle, après moult tergiversations, d'une nième loi sur l'immigration. 

Il s'agirait même de la faire voter avant l'été, ce qui montre assez l'invraisemblable légèreté avec laquelle président et ministres traitent ce sujet, le plus important et de loin de tous ceux qui intéressent le présent et le futur de la nation. Le seul fait de le désigner sous le nom d'""immigration"", comme aux XIXe et XXe siècles, est la preuve qu'on n'y comprend rien, ou qu'on est bien décidé à en dissimuler la formidable gravité au peuple (en quoi l'on continue à se montrer négationniste, et pas seulement génocidaire). En effet il ne s'agit plus depuis longtemps d'immigration, mais de submersion migratoire, de colonisation, d'islamisation, de changement de peuple et de civilisation, de génocide par substitution ; et le seul point à débattre, dans un pays qui saurait ce qu'il est, serait bien sûr la remigration, c'est-à-dire la libération du territoire, la décolonisation, le retour chez lui de l'occupant imposé.",0.165053,0.011672974,0.123407245,0.043916557,0.009981008,0.051580742

Sur les zones de silence dans les trains

Le parti de l’In-nocence ne peut que se réjouir vivement de l’instauration dans ses trains, par la SNCF, d’une zone de silence où il est interdit de faire usage de son téléphone portable, de parler, d’écouter quoi que ce soit si les autres passagers sont forcés d’en percevoir tout ou partie : rien n‘est plus conforme que cette décision aux principes fondamentaux de l’in-nocence, de la non-nocence, le bruit étant naturellement une des nocences les pires et les plus répandues. 

Le parti de l’in-nocence ne peut pas ne pas remarquer toutefois que cette instauration de zones de silence et de non-nocence est surtout, hélas, le reflet de son contraire : la société de nocence telle que l’instaurent la surpopulation et le remplacisme global, le Bidon-Monde. La décision de la SNCF est pleine de sagesse, mais elle devrait aller sans dire.

Nouvelle loi  antiraciste

Le gouvernement et le Bloc Génocidaire dont il est l’expression s’apprêtent à renforcer une fois de plus la législation dite “contre le racisme et la discrimination”. On ne pourrait naturellement qu’applaudir, au moins s’agissant du racisme, si le mot était entendu, comme le gouvernement voudrait qu’il le soit, au sens ancien d’injustice, de violence ou d’incitation véritable à la haine. On sait bien, hélas, qu’il n’est plus depuis longtemps, comme d'ailleurs la haine elle-même, qu’un nom de code pour toute résistance à la colonisation imposée, au changement de peuple et de civilisation, au génocide par substitution, au Grand Remplacement. Quant à la discrimination, ce n‘est pas moins qu’il en faut, c’est davantage au contraire, entre citoyens et non-citoyens, entre peuple indigène livré et colonisateur appelé, entre occupés et occupants, entre remplacés et remplaçants. Puisque l’antiracisme, de protecteur qu’il était, est devenu génocidaire par substitution et ne signifie plus que le consentement enthousiaste ou désolé à la Destruction des Européens d‘Europe et de leur civilisation, le racisme, de génocidaire qu’il fut, doit devenir ce qu‘il aurait dû toujours être d’après son nom,  à savoir protecteur des races, de toutes les races, et donc de la biodiversité humaine : in-nocent, décolonial, culturel, anti-terroriste, remigrationniste, indigéniste et libérateur.",0.17371799,0.0104522705,0.14150882,0.023174755,0.010576514,0.052490227

La surpopulation carcérale

Le début d’année est l’occasion d‘une nouvelle sortie dans les eaux médiatiques du vieux serpent de mer dit “surpopulation carcérale”. Il n’est sans doute aucun sujet sur lequel se prodigue plus de phrases pour rien et se témoigne plus d’aveuglement volontaire que celui-là. Ainsi il n’est question, pour une ébauche de solution, que de construire plus de prisons et de réduire les peines : c’est-à-dire d’aggraver encore l’horreur du vivre ensemble et de rendre plus banale sa quotidienne atrocité. Le seul remède à la surpopulation carcérale, tout le monde le connaît. S’agissant de la France, c’est le même que celui de la surpopulation en général : la remigration, la décolonisation, la libération du territoire, le départ de l’occupant ; mais comme il implique nécessairement la mise à l’écart de l’actuel médecin prescripteur, “l’occupateur” — le Bloc Génocidaire et ses milices —, il est interdit de le mentionner et tout le monde parle pour ne rien dire.",0.11388343,0.0060653687,0.0836065,0.026180768,0.007637825,0.010211408

Toute l’arrogance islamiste est dans l’utilisation comme argument de cette affirmation factuellement exacte. Bien avant d’être le troisième lieu saint de l’islamisme, en effet, le Mont du Temple est évidemment le premier lieu saint du judaïsme, dont les fidèles n’en ont été écartés que par les diverses conquêtes et colonisations dont leur pays a fait l’objet à travers l’histoire.

L’affaire Fournas

Un député du Rassemblement national, M. Grégoire de Fournas, souhaite qu’un navire chargé de remplaçants rentre en Afrique avec ses passagers. Comme, pour exprimer ce sentiment parfaitement légitime, il interrompt un de ces collègues qui parlait de cela et se trouve être noir, le Bloc Génocidaire unanime, trop heureux, saute sur l’occasion et accuse non seulement le député Fournas mais son parti d’être fidèles, malgré leurs tentatives de dédiabolisation, à leur fondamental racisme. L’exemple est peu convaincant, mais la charge est foudroyante. Aussitôt tout le monde s’indigne et s’aligne, ce qui au demeurant permet d‘établir une carte rigoureuse du Bloc Génocidaire. Ce mot de “racisme” fait toute sa puissance, par la peur qu’il exerce. Or ce n'est évidemment pas le racisme qui est génocidaire aujourd’hui, mais l’antiracisme.

Le génocide de confort

Le gouvernement expose les grands traits de sa centième loi sur “l’immigration ” (ce vieux mot du XXe siècle). Pour se montrer ferme il promet de faire mieux respecter les obligations de quitter le territoire, assurance mille fois prodiguée et jamais tenue ; et pour se montrer pratique, moderne et plein de bon sens, il annonce la création d’un visa spécial destiné à soulager la tension des “métiers sous tension” : c’est-à-dire l’établissement d’une nouvelle et formidable filière d’importation d'immigrés qui bien sûr, une fois dans la place, ne repartirons jamais. 

L’emploi est décidément au centre des deux catastrophes qui ravagent notre malheureux pays : la destruction des paysages et le génocide par substitution. Ce sont les nécessités de l’emploi qui sont le plus régulièrement évoquées pour écarter toute résistance à la dévastation de la Terre ; et c’est le besoin de pourvoir à l’emploi qui sert incessamment à changer de peuple. Les indigènes français sont victimes d‘un génocide de confort, en somme.

Lola, “The Times“ et les néo-nazis

Le Times, de Londres, qui fut longtemps, bien plus que Le Monde, un journal prestigieux, de haute qualité et du plus grand sérieux, et qui, comme Le Monde, a dégénéré, sous l'effet de la grande déculturation et du mcwokisme généralisé, en bulletin de propagande du remplacisme global davocratique et du Bloc Génocidaire, informe ses lecteurs qu’en France les néo-nazis, sic, exploitent ignominieusement la mort atroce de la petite fille Lola, et qu’ils essaient d’en faire une affaire d’État, afin de remettre en cause l’immigration. 
Rien n‘est plus significatif du faussel, ce réel à l’envers que tisse jour après jour le négationnisme global, celui qui nie la réalité du génocide par substitution. Héritiers naturels du nazisme, de son Ost-Plan et de son Umvolkung, les champions du Grand Remplacement traitent de néo-nazis ceux qui s’opposent à leurs desseins criminels et qui se permettent d'en relever les abominables effets. Il n‘y a aucune espèce de limite à l’énormité de leurs mensonges et diffamations, et l’on ne sera jamais trop abrupt pour dénoncer leur brutalité envers la vérité comme envers les peuples et les individus. La gestion du Bidon-Monde par Davos et les industries de l’homme est d‘ailleurs particulièrement en évidence à Londres, où siège le Times, dans la capitale à maire musulman d’une Grande-Bretagne à Premier ministre hindou. Ce dernier est le produit direct, plus direct encore que notre Emmanuel Macron, via Goldmann-Sachs et les hedge-funds, de la davocratie, qui raccourcit encore ses circuits et poursuit son éradication des strates intermédiaires, puisque cette fois elle place un remplaçant de chez elle à la tête d’une des plus grandes puissances occidentales.",0.2820025,0.023076924,0.25205973,0.15459715,0.02440793,0.23163283

Sur le nouveau “lac” de La Clusaz

Le parti de l’In-nocence est bien sûr opposé de la façon la plus radicale, comme tous les autres mouvements écologistes, locaux, nationaux et internationaux, au projet d’un nouveau “lac” ou plutôt réservoir à La Clusaz, destiné principalement à la confection de neige artificielle pour le ski, et contribuant ainsi doublement à la désastreuse artificialisation du paysage et de la montagne. On peut mal concevoir un plus cynique dessein. Bien entendu, et pour ainsi dire comme chaque fois, il se donne pour prétexte la nécessité de défendre l’emploi. L’emploi, dont on ne saurait trop rappeler qu’il n’est pas une fin en soi, aura décidément été le pire ennemi de la conservation de la planète. Quitte à l’invoquer sans cesse néanmoins, mieux vaudrait lui trouver des objectifs et des usages plus compatibles avec la préservation du monde et de sa beauté que leur exploitation à outrance.

Jérusalem et l’Australie

L’Australie décide fermer son ambassade à Jérusalem, et de la ramener à Tel-Aviv, comme devant. Elle a tort. Que Jérusalem soit la capitale de l’État d’Israël, et l’État d’Israël la nation du peuple juif, c’est l’étalon-or de toutes les appartenances : historiques, culturelles, religieuses, cratyliennes, raciales. 

On peut contester l’appartenance de l’Australie aux actuels Australiens, pas celle de Jérusalem aux Israéliens. Si Jérusalem n’était pas à Israël, et si Israël n’était pas aux juifs, il n’y aurait plus aucune raison pour que Paris soit à la France et la France aux Français, ni l’Angleterre aux Anglais, l’Afrique aux Africains, l’Europe aux Européens : ce qui est précisément, cette déconstruction de l’identité, cette destruction de l’appartenance, ce que désirent par-dessus tout le remplacisme global davocratique, les industries de l’homme interchangeable et remplaçable, la gestion managériale, pan-économique, antiraciste et génocidaire du parc humain.",0.11129999,0.0049591064,0.032689095,0.023311393,0.008919456,0.10221587

Mahsa et Lola

Le Bloc Génocidaire unanime déplore, et il a mille fois raison, le sort effroyable de la jeune Iranienne Mahsa Amini, tuée le mois dernier par la police des mœurs, en Iran, pour un foulard mal ajusté. Il soutient les Iraniens et les Iraniennes qui manifestent en réaction à ce crime : et certes nous les soutenons nous aussi, espérant même qu‘ils renverseront l’odieux régime de mollahs. 

En revanche le Bloc Génocidaire ne paraît aucunement troublé par un drame plus épouvantable encore, s’il se peut, et plus proche : le dépeçage après viol, semble-t-il, par quatre Algériens, avant-hier, d’une petite fille française de douze ans, Lola X., retrouvée en morceaux dans une valise. De cette abomination-là c‘est tout juste si ses médias paraissent s’aviser, et ses gestionnaires au pouvoir n’ont pas un mot pour s’en attrister. Même le président de Davos-France préfère réserver ses interventions à la commémoration, pour le cinquante et unième anniversaire de l’événement (!), des victimes algériennes de la répression française d’une manifestation anticolonialiste des actuels colonisateurs de la France. 
 
Faut-il preuve plus criante du faussel, le réel faux, le réel de fabrication selon les exigences et les interdits du remplacisme global davocratique ? Il est vrai que le cas de l’infortunée Lola est un emblème trop parfait, sans doute, et du martyre du peuple livré à un colonisateur féroce, et du sort que réservent aux individus, surtout les plus désarmés, les cyniques industries de l’homme, bien assurées qu’elles sont de l‘hébétude qu’elles ont créée.",0.19939905,0.023076924,0.16802633,0.04366605,0.039947584,0.11047905

Les uniformes de l‘occupant

Le faussel, ou réel inversé, réel faux, faux réel ou négationnisme global —  à la fois la  réalité du mensonge et son langage — atteint ces jours-ci des sommets inédits. De graves pseudo-débats s‘essaient à décider, et surtout à ne pas décider, naturellement, si telles ou telles tenues exotiques arborées par un nombre croissant de lycéens et collégiens, garçons et filles, relèvent de l’ostentation religieuse ou bien de l’affirmation culturelle, du folklore ou le la foi. Il faut espérer que ceux qui se livrent à ces discussions sans substance sont les premiers conscients de leur caractère dérisoire. L’occupant colonial imposé, sachant bien qu’il gagne à tout coup grâce à la complicité de l‘occupateur, de ses journalistes, de ses intellectuels et de ses juges (le Bloc Génocidaire), veut à présent faire parade de ses uniformes et de sa victoire dans les établissements scolaires de la nation livrée ; et telle est la seule vérité — tout le reste est discours pour rien, leurres et voilages non-ajustés, tâtonnements d’aveugles volontaires dans l’abîme et dans ses égouts.",0.10002319,0.0030517578,0.045593183,0.02303812,0.008634649,0.01465176

Sur le racisme et le bruit 

Le parti de l’In-nocence observe avec intérêt que déplorer le bruit — et notamment le bruit des personnes qui parlent trop fort dans les lieux publics, dans les immeubles, les hôtels ou les transports en commun, sur leurs téléphones portables ou à leurs voisins, ou à des tiers éloignés, voire seules — est désormais considéré comme raciste (sic). Ainsi en juge le mouvement woke, ou wokisme, ou mcwokisme, qui est l’aile marchante du remplacisme global davocratique et la milice idéologique de son Bloc Génocidaire. Et c’est un bel hommage au racisme, aux races ou à certaines d’entre elles, les plus amies du silence. 

Le parti de l’In-nocence l’a souligné de longue date, le bruit est une des toutes premières et des plus graves des nocences ; et le contrôle de sa propre voix, le souci de ne pas l‘imposer aux autres, le chuchotement ou le silence, sont avec les manières de table un de ces préalables à l’éducation sans lesquels elle n’est pas possible, non plus que la civilisation et la tranquillité publique. L’antiracisme woke, en assumant la défense d’un droit au bruit, et en revendiquant comme légitime ou vertueuse l’imposition sonore, au moins pour l’occupant, confirme qu’il est le promoteur décomplexé de la nocence sous toutes ses formes, dès lors qu’elle est bien l‘instrument du Grand Remplacement, ou génocide par substitution.",0.15711457,0.0074768066,0.06512285,0.06044999,0.01698343,0.10221587

Sur la “senne déversale”

Le parti de l’In-nocence juge aussi désastreuse qu’indigne l’absence de condamnation et d’interdiction, par l’Union européenne, le 29 septembre dernier, de l’effroyable pratique de pêche industrielle dite “senne déversale”. Cette pratique, dont les pêcheurs néerlandais sont les principaux promoteurs et habitués, est aussi inepte écologiquement et même économiquement, à moyen terme, puisqu’elle va rapidement faire disparaître tous les poissons de la mer du Nord, qu’elle est cruelle et déloyale moralement, puisque ses vibrations d’encerclement ne laissent à ses victimes aucune chance d’en réchapper. La France avait la possibilité de s’y opposer. Elle l’a laissé passer, en présentant à Bruxelles, par maladresse ou par volonté délibérée d'échouer, une motion si mal tournée que les autres pays ne pouvaient la soutenir.

🔥 FIRE WEATHER: A combination of strong northerly winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels will contribute to extreme fire behavior today. A Red Flag Warning in effect from 9am this morning until 7pm tonight. Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly. Outdoor burning is NOT recommended.

🌬 WIND: A prolonged period of gusty winds is expected today and Thursday due to the gradient between Hurricane Ian entering the Gulf of Mexico and high-pressure building into the area from the north.

 A WIND ADVISORY is in effect today through early this evening across most inland areas for sustained winds of 15-20mph with gusts up to 35mph. Along the coast, a wind advisory will be in effect today and continue overnight for sustained winds of 20-30mph with gusts up to 40mph. 

A GALE WARNING in effect until Thursday evening for frequent gusts to gale force across the Mississippi Sound, southern Mobile Bay, and Gulf waters our to 20 nautical miles. A GALE WARNING is also in effect until early Friday morning for frequent gusts to gale force across the Gulf waters out 20-60 nautical miles. 

COASTAL CONCERNS   
o Surf will increase to 3-4 feet tonight into Wednesday
o High rip current risk Wednesday through at least Friday night
o Some wave run-up is possible along the Gulf facing barrier islands and beaches
o Low water levels are possible on Wednesday and likely on Thursday and Friday during periods of low tide due to the persistent strong northeasterly winds (especially in Mobile Bay where water levels 2 feet below normal are possible on Thursday and Friday)

Ian is projected to be a major hurricane near Western Cuba and slow down to near 5MPH as it draws closer to Central Florida. The track has shifted a bit farther East away from our area. Although models are coming together and greater confidence exists in the track, changes can always happen. 

Don’t turn your back on Ian. As you can see from the graphics, significant rainfall and storm sure are not currently expected in our area. We will certainly have gusty winds and elevated sustained winds along the coast, but we will know more about specific local impacts after a call with US National Weather Service Tallahassee Florida this afternoon.

Sur la répartition des remplaçants dans les campagnes

Le projet présidentiel de répartition de l’“immigration” dans les campagnes présente tous les caractères coutumiers de la duperie remplaciste davocratique. Il monte en épingle la relance d'une vieille promesse jamais tenue — et pour cause —, les reconduites à la frontière, à seule fin de faire mieux admettre une réalité criminelle, l’élargissement du Grand Remplacement aux ultimes recoins du territoire qui pourraient y avoir échappé encore. Le seul terme anachronique et menteur d“’immigration” expose assez la fausseté de tout le projet : l’immigration est un phénomène des XIXe et XXe siècle qui n’a rien à voir avec l’actuelle submersion migratoire, la colonisation imposée, l’occupation étrangère, ni, à fortiori, avec le génocide par substitution en cours. 

Les campagnes ne sont nullement dépeuplées, encore moins désertifiées. Elles sont abandonnées par les services publics d’un pouvoir davocratique qui ne songe qu’à les livrer d’un même élan, comme l’ensemble du pays, à l’artificialisation, aux éoliennes, aux champs photovoltaïques, à la banlieue universelle, au Bidon-Monde et, bien entendu, au changement de peuple et de civilisation.",0.13041082,0.0037956238,0.071433455,0.023106437,0.0076507707,0.038167715

Mort d’Élisabeth II, reine d’Angleterre

La reine d‘Angleterre est morte. Elle était une figure sur laquelle ont convergé les regards et la considération  respectueuse de l’humanité entière durant trois-quarts de siècle. Le Conseil National de la Résistance Européenne ne peut s’empêcher de relever toutefois que son règne est de très loin le plus triste de toute l‘histoire de son pays. En effet il a vu ce qui, à des générations d‘Anglais, d’Écossais, de Gallois et d’autres, eût semblé le plus inconcevablement horrible, et contre quoi ils s’étaient battus avec un si héroïque courage si peu de temps avant son avènement : l’invasion, la conquête et la colonisation étrangères, le changement de peuple et de civilisation, le génocide par substitution. Contre cette abomination, la souveraine n‘a pas eu un seul mot. Certes le pouvoir politique ne lui appartenait pas, mais le Grand Remplacement n’est pas une affaire de politique : c’est une question de vie ou de mort, pour un peuple. Élisabeth II était la femme la plus célèbre du monde : à tout moment elle pouvait parler. Une phrase d’elle aurait tout changé. La postérité jugera son silence plus coupable que celui, d’ailleurs tout relatif de Pie XII, car elle avait plus de moyens que ce pape de modifier le cours de l'histoire sans faire courir de risques terribles à des millions d‘hommes et de femmes.

16314,"Races et silence
(La Dépossession, chap. 58)

Les races ont très mal pris la nouvelle de leur inexistence, d’autant que personne n’avait cru bon de les avertir de la proclamation imminente du Dogme. Comme les indigènes français lorsqu’on leur fait savoir qu’il n’existe rien de tel que des “Français de souche”, que la notion de “peuple français” est purement administrative, juridique, et que la culture française n’existe pas, elles ont ressent une terrible colère, doublée d’une atroce humiliation. Néanmoins, et contrairement au peuple français, resté ahuri sous le coup, ou qui l’était déjà avant lui, elles se sont bien vengées. C’est à croire que, moins elles existent, officiellement, plus elles sont agissantes. Et c’est à se demander s’il fut jamais époque de l’histoire où leur poids sur la marche du monde, et sur la fabrique des opinions, se soit pareillement fait sentir.

Ce poids n’a d’égal en intensité que le tabou dont il fait l’objet. Les races ayant été proclamées inexistantes par la science en son geste le plus servile et le plus bête, mais aussi le plus solennel, le mieux serti de pompe; de menaces et d‘interdits, il n’est évidemment plus possible pour qui que ce soit, sauf profond désir d’en finir avec la vie, de les faire intervenir ouvertement comme facteur herméneutique des événements tels qu’ils surviennent au jour le jour ; et notamment des faits-divers, dont la plupart, pourtant, seraient plus justement appelés faits de la diversité, si le tabou lié au Dogme, précisément, ne l’empêchait.

Le négationnisme global, dont nous avons vu et dont nous verrons à l’envi qu’il est consubstantiel au remplacisme du même nom (cette ère du faux, du faussel, de l’ersatz, de la contrefaçon), possède là l’un de ses points d’ancrage les plus manifestes, et, du fait même, les plus menteurs. La plupart des faits-divers, en effet, ne sont faits-divers — c’est-à-dire soustraits à l’histoire, réduits au statut de simples incidents ou accidents comme il y en a toujours eu entre les individus au sein de toutes les sociétés — que dans la mesure où les races, dont il n’est pas rare qu’elles soient pourtant leur seule explication et qu’elles soient seules à les rendre intelligibles, sont soigneusement extirpées de leur relation médiatique. C’est la pratique la plus coutumière de la Grande Presse, passée maître en cet exercice, et qui témoigne rarement autant qu’en cette chirurgie à la Procuste sa soumission à l’exigence de silence, sa participation enthousiaste et forcée au négationnisme global, son appartenance (souvent littérale) aux industries de l’homme, bref son rôle capital, sans autre rival que celui de l’École, dans le grand broyage de l’espèce. Elle dit tous les jours, et plusieurs fois par jour : “Une femme de quatre-vingt-sept ans a été violée dans son pavillon, un suspect a été interpellé”, “Alors qu’il tentait de protéger sa compagne, un homme est victime d’un coup de couteau à la gorge”, “Graves incidents lors d’un mariage à Villeneuve-d’Ascq” ; et ce matin encore : “Trois policiers ont été blessés à Nice ce dimanche en intervenant sur le tournage d’un clip de rap non autorisé. Ils ont essuyé des tirs de mortiers d’artifice et des jets de projectiles. Deux mineurs ont été interpellés”. Or, si aucun autre renseignement n’est fourni, même pas des noms et des prénoms, quant à la nature, l’identité, l’appartenance, la race, des coupables et des victimes, des agresseurs et des agressés ; si l’on ne peut pas savoir, sinon par intuition et par habitude, par expérience du décryptage, s’il s’agit d’indigènes ou d’occupants, de colonisateurs ou de colonisés, de blancs ou de noirs, d’arabes ou de juifs ; si tout cela est laissé dans l’ombre, alors on n’a affaire en effet qu’à des faits-divers, à une curieuse accumulation de faits-divers, étonnamment semblables et répétitifs, qui ne sauraient relever, au mieux, dès lors qu’on tiendrait absolument à se pencher sur leur nature profonde ou à formuler quelque loi tendant à expliquer leur singulière récurrence et leur nombre, que de la misère sociale, des inégalités qui s’accroissent, du racisme structurel de la société française, du scandaleux abandon où sont laissées les banlieues par les pouvoirs publics. Mais la plupart du temps l’analyse ne va même pas si loin, ce qui serait encore risquer d’ouvrir la boîte de Pandore de la vérité. Et comme toujours en société négationniste globale, la vérité est précisément ce qui ne doit jamais être approché : elle pourrait tenter de se saisir de vous.

Les faits-divers et leurs accueillantes rubriques servent précisément à éviter ce danger. Si les événements, comme on parlait au siècle dernier des événements d’Algérie pour que nommer seulement la guerre n’aille pas la faire exister, si les événements, donc, les tirs de mortier sur les commissariats, les mariages qui imposent leur bruit, leur violence et leurs drapeaux étrangers à une ville entière et la paralysent, les invasions de piscines privées et les mises à sac (truncated)",0.1798404,0.013478675,0.07460167,0.05243378,0.011327368,0.17303948

Very interesting!

You need to hear the awful defence of Elizabeth Truss, the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs – particularly her strategy towards stopping the crisis and bringing the perpetrators to justice and other of her wobbling submissions. 

Note, till date not one person has been prosecuted and convicted for the killings.

We are grateful to the following MPs for debating this critical issue:

Fiona Bruce – Congleton 
Bambos Charalambous – Enfield, Southgate

Well, you have already said what is before us today. First of all, we are waiting for the President to sign the Electoral Act; only God knows – maybe until after the elections that he will sign the bill. But when he signs it, we will expect – of course - that INEC will release their guidelines. And when INEC releases its own guidelines, we expect the political parties to read and adopt which option.
 
In the draft Electoral Act, we have three options: direct, indirect and consensus. Each political party will now decide which option it will adopt.  Then, we will know. But my senses tell me that the PDP will go for the indirect primaries. Because, we believe that that is the most efficient and that is the less expensive and also it brings politically enlightened members of the party to make a very important decision for the party, on behalf of the party. So, we still have a little bit of time to wait. Hopefully, before the end of this month, we will have the Electoral Bill signed into law. 
 
What is important is that we have people who are already statutory delegates. Meaning: governors and former governors; senators and former senators; members of the House of Representatives and former members of the House of Representatives – who are still members of our party. Do you understand? And then, we have elected delegates, right? Now, these elected delegates are the people that we don’t know. But we already know who the statutory delegates are.  So, currently, the statutory delegates should be our targets. These are the people that we must reach out to until the party lets us know who the elected delegates are. This is how we will form the Electoral College that will elect the candidate. I believe that you will work towards…. Many of you are friends with members of the National Assembly; many of you are friends with current and past governors and so on and so forth. These are people that you should target or you should lobby and let them know that this is the person that is best suited for our party, if you want to rescue the country. 
 
So, I thank you very much indeed and I look forward to interacting with you, you know, again in the future, as developments occur. If there is need on your own part to be with me, fine; if there is need for my own part to be with you, good enough. I request through the High Chief (Raymond Dokpesi).
 
I want to commend you for the work that you have done so far by enlightening the citizens of this country on the choices before us as a country. I have never seen this country have so many challenges at the same time. Sometimes when I lay down on my bed, I begin to wonder whether I should go for this thing or not, because, the challenges are just too many. All my life, I have never seen the country in such a bad situation. As far as the unity of the country is concerned, we are more divided, in fact more divided even than when we fought the civil war. We were never as divided as this. We never had breakdown of law and order like this. When we fought the civil war, it was confined in a particular place, every other place was peaceful and we didn’t have this kind of poverty where even the farmer could not go the field to plant what he will eat, not to talk of commercial quantity. 
 
So, it is daunting task for anybody to come and turn things around. And, I have heard people talk about ‘oh… we should give it to a young man, or we should not give it to an old man, we should give it to a middle aged man, and so on and so forth.’ Of course, they have the freedom of speech and they can say anything. But fundamentally, the constitution says that all of us can contest. The constitution has not barred anyone of us. There is no zoning in the constitution. There is none. I was a member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted this very constitution. Then, as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country, we felt that there should be a sense of belonging.

Mais Eric Zemmour la place au cœur de la discussion politique. Et les universitaires, comme l’historien Gérard Noiriel, doivent rappeler, encore et encore, que cette théorie n’a aucun fondement statistique ou sociologique. Elle n’est même pas nouvelle. 

Elle a été au centre de l’idéologie antisémite à la fin du XIXe siècle. Contrairement à aujourd’hui, les polémistes d’alors affirmaient que le grand remplacement se faisait par en haut, expliquant que les juifs cherchaient à asservir le peuple français en contrôlant l’économie, les médias et la politique.

Le parti de l’In-nocence n’est certes pas favorable à l’invasion migratoire et au génocide par substitution qui s’ensuit. Aussi se trouve-t-il profondément divisé avec lui-même quand la Pologne, qu’il a toujours soutenue dans sa résistance au Grand Remplacement, met en œuvre un projet de mur à édifier au beau milieu de la forêt primaire de Bialowieza, la dernière d’Europe. Protéger l’Europe du changement de peuple et de civilisation ne saurait être trop encouragé, certes. Mais il en va là comme pour les écologistes qui prétendent protéger les territoires du réchauffement climatique en y dressant partout des éoliennes. À quoi bon gâcher irrémédiablement ce que l’on croit vouloir défendre ? Pour que la Pologne reste la Pologne, et l’Europe l’Europe, il est capital que la forêt de Bialowieza demeure intacte.

Soixante-dix ans plus tard, par l’effet d’un renversement d’attitude et de tempérament aussi invraisemblable qu’inexplicable, on retrouve un royaume envahi, que ses peuples indigènes accablés, ou, pis encore, ravis, ou résignés, partagent avec tous les peuples de la Terre, tandis que se perd sous nos yeux, dans la criminalité, la déréliction urbaine et le chaos social, tout ce qui faisait le caractère unique, la noblesse et la séduction d’une civilisation parmi les plus hautes et les plus raffinées que l’Europe et la Terre aient connues.

La protection de l'OTAN devrait aussi lui être immédiatement accordée ; mais bien préférable évidemment serait la protection d'une force militaire européenne, actuellement inexistante, hélas, mais dont la création urgente ne se fait que davantage sentir chaque jour.

Le parti de l'In-nocence n'en continue pas moins d'estimer bien sûr que de telles mesures ne seraient nullement incompatibles avec des négociations entre l'Ukraine et la Russie, éventuellement par l'entremise de l'Europe, sur de légitimes rectifications de frontières assurant à tous les peuples leur appartenance aux nations dont ils relèvent par leur histoire, leur culture et leur langue.",0.10566349,0.004749298,0.030154925,0.024062896,0.032695748,0.038683333

30464,"Congressman Gaetz Issues Letter to Governor DeSantis Regarding Illegal Vaccine Passports at 30A Songwriters Festival

U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-01) sent the following letter this afternoon to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis regarding the illegal implementation of vaccine passports at the 30A Songwriters Festival in the First Congressional District of Florida.
 
Full text of the letter sent to Governor DeSantis follows:
 
Governor Ron DeSantis
State of Florida
The Capitol
400 South Monroe Street
Tallahassee, Florida 32399
 
Dear Governor DeSantis:
 
I hope this letter finds you well. On behalf of my constituents, thank you for your bold leadership and sound stewardship of our beloved Florida.
 
Regrettably, I write to inform you that within my congressional district there appears to be a blatant violation of Executive Order 21-81, “Prohibiting COVID-19 Vaccine Passports.” Your executive order allows entities to engage in COVID-19 screening, generally, but does not permit different treatment for the vaccinated and unvaccinated. 
 
The 30A Songwriters Festival is requiring all participants and patrons to:
 
“show proof of full vaccination (two shots of Moderna or Pfizer or one shot of Johnson & Johnson) or proof of a professionally administered negative COVID test within 72 hours immediately prior to the start of the Festival.”
 
This Festival is funded in part by the Tourist Development Council of Walton County, utilizing taxpayer funds. Vaccine passports should not be funded by Florida taxpayers.
 
I ask that you give this matter your immediate attention and inform the Walton County Tourist Development Council of the ramifications if they proceed in funding the 30A Songwriters Festival under these unlawful conditions.
 
Respectfully,
Matt Gaetz
Member of Congress",0.15435068,0.0064086914,0.03412145,0.075792134,0.05171447,0.06249457

Sur les rafales, les tortures et les princes

Le parti de l’In-nocence constate que rarement la politique extérieure de la France aura été une chose aussi incohérente, cynique et basse que sous la présidence d’Emmanuel Macron — du moins n’a-t-elle d’autre cohérence que son cynisme, sa bassesse et de petits intérêts d’épicerie, ou plutôt de porteur de valise qui espère un bon pourboire. À quelques jours d’intervalle on voit le prétendu pays des droits de l’homme, cette tyrannie remplaciste livrant incessamment son propre peuple, apporter sa voix à l’élection à la tête d’Interpol d’un général émirati notoirement tortionnaire, et le président de la République se rendre à Riyad, le premier de toute la communauté internationale, pour s’incliner devant le prince héritier d’Arabie saoudite, encore tout sanglant du corps d’un journaliste découpé sur ses ordres. Il va sans dire que dans le même temps notre malheureux pays, vautré dans l’ignominie, se targue d’un fabuleux contrat de vente d’avions “Rafale”, après toutes les ventes dans les mêmes régions d’équipes de football, de monuments historiques et de grands hôtels.  La France est bradée à l’encan, souvent sous le prétexte de l’emploi, qui décidément aura été depuis des lustres la meilleure couverture au désastre diplomatique et moral comme au désastre écologique.

Sur la proposition de Fabien Roussel
https://cnre.eu/communiques/212

Le député communiste Fabien Roussel, candidat de son parti à la présidence de la République, propose à l’Assemblée nationale une nouvelle loi ou un renforcement des lois existantes, afin de rendre inéligibles les personnes condamnées pour antisémitisme, racisme ou incitation à la haine raciale. Quand on sait que cette dernière qualification, au moins, est utilisée par les juges sans relation aucune, en général, à la moindre haine, incitation à la haine, ou appel à la violence, non plus, toujours en général, qu’à la moindre race, on mesure à quel point le BNG (Bloc Négationniste-Génocidaire) — c’est-à-dire l’ensemble des forces qui assurent et promeuvent le changement de peuple et de civilisation tout en le niant — s’estime désormais tout-puissant : ce que, à la vérité, il n’est pas loin d’être, puisqu’il a criminalisé la moindre réserve envers le génocide par substitution qu’il accomplit avec tant d‘ardeur.

Il est éminemment parlant que ce soit un membre du Parti communiste — bien à l’abri derrière le stupéfiant “deux poids deux mesures” selon lequel les dizaines de millions de morts que son idéologie a sur la conscience ne pèsent rien au regard des millions de morts de l’idéologie nationale-socialiste — qui recommande, fort de toute l’expérience répressive et liberticide de son bord, cette mesure si manifestement contraire aux plus élémentaires principes de l’État de droit.

Le ministre des Outre-Mer et la décolonisation
https://www.cnre.eu/communiques/210

M. Sébastien Lecornu, ministre des Outre-Mer — ce seul nom maladroit en français montre assez que quelque chose ne va pas : pourquoi pas “de la France d’Outre-Mer” ? — rappelle, à très juste titre, que la Nouvelle-Calédonie figure sur une liste des territoires qui restent à décoloniser. M. Lecornu a raison sur le fond, et sur le fait. Cependant on pourra juger singulier qu’il estime opportun de procéder à ce rappel à la veille d’un troisième référendum sur l’indépendance du territoire, ce qui ressemble fort à une prise de position en faveur de celle-ci, là où l’on eût pu attendre, de la part du gouvernement français, à tout le moins la neutralité. Mais surtout la manière de poser la question est invraisemblablement archaïque et désuète, et relève d’une époque tout à fait révolue. En un temps où la France et l’Europe sont cent fois plus colonisées, et plus profondément, et plus massivement, qu’elles ont jamais colonisé elles-mêmes, ce sont elles qui devraient figurer sur la liste des territoires restant à décoloniser, et ce sont elles qui devraient donner le signal de la révolte indigène.",0.049584184,0.0024604797,0.03489272,0.015932998,0.0056959605,0.005919657

Xavier Bertrand et les procureurs

La fureur négationniste-génocidaire ne connaît plus de bornes, même dans les partis politiques du remplacisme mou. Affolé par la montée dans les sondages d’Éric Zemmour, M. Xavier Bertrand, candidat à la candidature “LR” à la présidence de la République propose, afin que décidément la question du Grand Remplacement n’affleure sous aucun prétexte dans le débat, que les procureurs de la République, c’est-à-dire la voix même de la répression, puissent eux-mêmes prononcer les sentences et condamner plus vite ceux qui protesteraient contre le changement de peuple. Cette disposition inouïe mettrait évidemment à bas tout le système judiciaire français, et d’ailleurs toute idée de la justice civilisée dans le monde. Sous prétexte de mieux défendre un État de droit nullement menacé — sinon bien sûr par l’invasion, la colonisation et l’occupation —, on le détruit. Pour sauver les fameuses “valeurs de la République”, qui, il est vrai, font tant pour le génocide par substitution, on les abolit.

Même lorsqu’est assurée, et ce n’est pas toujours le cas, la conservation des monuments historiques, elle est tout à fait insuffisante quand ils sont dotés de mobilier et de collections qui leur sont propres et qui se trouvent séparés d’eux, comme à Rosny-sur-Seine il y a quelques années, ou plus récemment à Barante, dans le Puy-de-Dôme,  alors qu’ils sont une part essentielle de leur personnalité.

93, les agents ÉDF escortés
https://www.cnre.eu/communiques/207

L’Électricité De France ressent de façon urgente le besoin de doubler ses agents, quand ils vont relever les compteurs chez les particuliers, par d’autres agents, chargés ceux-là d’assurer la sécurité des premiers. On entre ainsi très officiellement dans une société de violence généralisée, où il est considéré comme acquis qu’une agression peut éclater à tout moment. L’explication donnée à la mesure hautement symbolique qui vient d’être prise, c’est que les nouvelles dispositions sur les allocations de chômage, augmentant les difficultés des plus pauvres, rendent l’insécurité plus grande. Mais un détail montre clairement que la vraie cause, comme d’habitude, n’est pas du tout là. C’est dans le département de la Seine-Saint-Denis (93), c’est-à-dire au cœur de la plus occupée des France occupées, que le service de protection des agents sera d’abord mis en application. Ainsi se manifeste de façon éclatante, malgré le silence et le mensonge imposés par le Bloc Négationniste-Génocidaire (BNG), la réalité de la vie quotidienne dans la France livrée : son extrême brutalité, son caractère explosif, ses dangers de tous les instants pour les représentants de quoi que ce soit de français.

Sur la Chine et la croissance démographique

Le gouvernement chinois, dont le peuple est un des deux plus nombreux du monde, s'inquiète de sa décroissance démographique. C'est témoigner une rare inconscience de la situation de la planète, de l'espèce humaine et même de l'avenir de la vie en Chine. Après avoir très sagement, des années durant, limité à un enfant par couple la reproduction familiale, Pékin a d'abord aboli cette disposition — première erreur —, et voici maintenant qu'il interdit à peu près, ou qu'il rend impossible, l'interruption volontaire de grossesse. Il dit s'inquiéter du vieillissement et met en avant, pour expliquer sa nouvelle et indéfendable position, le souci des retraites. La préoccupation des retraites, dont l'humanité s'est passée des millénaires durant, aura décidément, à l'époque moderne, amené bien des désastres. En Europe elle a servi longtemps de prétexte au Grand Remplacement, ou génocide par substitution, mais même les plus ardents immigrationnistes n'osent plus aujourd'hui l'invoquer pour la cause remplaciste. Voici qu'elle est à présent convoquée pour servir en Asie, et sans doute ailleurs, de légitimation à la croissance démographique, cette première des causes du réchauffement climatique, comme de la plupart des maux de la Terre. Certes, l'absence de croissance, et a fortiori la décroissance, même mesurée, impliquent inévitablement un vieillissement de la population, avec les inconvénients, mais aussi les avantages, que peut impliquer cette évolution ; cependant c'est là peu cher payer la sauvegarde de ce qui reste d'espace libre et de terres épargnées par l'urbanisation, l'artificialisation et la culture intensive. Les gouvernements doivent faire porter leurs efforts sur les manières de prendre soin de la vieillesse et de la grande vieillesse chez les humains, et certainement pas infliger à leurs territoires une prolifération également fatale à la faune, à la flore, à la beauté des paysages, à la santé de l'âme et à la paix civile.",0.04240986,0.0022220612,0.024768941,0.013917602,0.006925808,0.014551271

Justin Trudeau

La victoire de M. Justin Trudeau aux élections législatives canadiennes est peut-être amère, comme dit la Grande Presse, mais c’est tout de même une victoire, et elle est surtout bien amère pour tous ceux qui sont accablés par ce qu’inflige cet homme au Canada, et surtout aux Canadiens, par lui grand-remplacés à marche forcée. Certes ils doivent beaucoup aux populations autochtones auxquelles ils se sont ajoutés ou substitués, certes ils ont une dette envers elles, mais ils ne doivent rien à tous ces peuples de la Terre, de préférence musulmans, qu’on leur impose pour remplaçants. Qu’ils se donnent à nouveau pour chef de gouvernement, volontairement, celui qui, par son enthousiasme remplaciste, est devenu, avec un Georges Soros, un Emmanuel Macron ou un François, l’une des figures de proue du génocide par substitution à travers le monde, force à se poser les plus sérieuses questions sur la démocratie même et sur son fonctionnement. Les élections sont-elles truquées ? Les électeurs sont-ils manipulés ou conditionnés par la Grande Presse ? Ou bien peut-il advenir vraiment que des peuples désirent leur propre effacement, serait-ce par submersion migratoire ?

Éric Zemmour et Youtube

L’enregistrement de l’entretien d’Éric Zemmour avec Laurent Ruquier et Léa Salamé sur France 2 le samedi 11 septembre 2021 a été retiré de la plateforme de vidéos en ligne Youtube (qui appartient à Google), et les milliers de commentaires qu’il avait suscités ont été effacés. Cette mesure est un tournant capital de l’asservissement du monde et de la dépossession de l’homme. Nous sommes tous, nous champions de l’anti-remplacisme et militants de la lutte contre le changement de peuple, très habitués à voir quotidiennement la liberté d’expression bafouée par les gafas, c’est-à-dire par la gestion davocratique du parc humain, bien résolue qu’elle est à écraser et confondre l’espèce. Mais il s’agit ici d’un potentiel candidat à la magistrature suprême en France, et dont la candidature est attendue et espérée par des millions de citoyens. Certes Twitter avait déjà fermé le compte du président de la première puissance mondiale ; mais cette fois c’est directement que la question du Grand Remplacement, du changement de peuple et de civilisation, du génocide par substitution, et à travers elle du remplacisme global, subit l’interdiction directe de tout affleurement dans le débat public. Or, elle est la question primordiale de ce qu’il en est d’être homme ou femme aujourd’hui sur la Terre. Davos, Youtube et la tyrannie davocratique disent d’elle, comme le juge d’Alfred Dreyfus : « la question ne sera pas posée », et ils agissent en conséquence. Tolérer cela serait s’accommoder de l’expulsion de l’humanité d’elle-même, consentir à l’homme remplaçable, se plier à la Machination, accepter le gouvernement du monde par les robots.

Special Tropical Weather Outlook (from 2:20 pm CDT earlier today - NHC hasn't yet issued their first advisory on Mindy)
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
320 PM EDT Wed Sep 8 2021

For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:

Special outlook issued to update discussion of the disturbance in 
the Gulf of Mexico. 

1. Updated:  Satellite and radar data indicate that shower and 
thunderstorm activity continues to gradually become better organized in association with an area of low pressure located about 115 miles southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. In addition, satellite-derived wind data indicate that the circulation has become somewhat better defined today. If these development trends continue, advisories will likely be initiated on this system as a tropical depression or tropical storm later this afternoon, and tropical storm warnings could be required for portions of the coast of the Florida Panhandle. After reaching the Florida Panhandle tonight, this system is expected to move across the southeastern United States and emerge over the western Atlantic by late Thursday, where environmental conditions appear unfavorable for additional development.  Regardless of development, areas of heavy rainfall are likely across portions of the Florida panhandle and southern Georgia through Thursday, with localized flooding possible.

37704,"HURRICANE IDA IS NOW IN THE SOUTHERN GULF; INTENSIFICATION LIKELY TODAY... Hurricane Ida continues to rapidly move northwest across the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico on this Saturday morning. Ida emerged from western Cuba last night and is now moving into an environment that is highly favorable for rapid intensification. Since last night, there have been no major changes to the forecast logic. Ida will almost certainly make landfall as a strong hurricane in Louisiana tomorrow (Sunday) afternoon or evening. Local impacts in south Alabama and northwest Florida will include the potential for heavy rain, gusty winds (especially near the Alabama coast), tornadoes, and flash flooding. Dangerous coastal hazards, including rip currents and high waves, have already started at the Alabama and northwest Florida beaches. Please do not get in the Gulf today or in the days ahead! A few more Saturday morning forecast notes are below.

LOCAL IMPACTS ASSESSMENT - HURRICANE IDA... Our local impacts discussion has not changed much at all since last night. The main impacts from Hurricane Ida in southwest Alabama and northwest Florida will happen from Sunday evening through Monday evening. Please remember that tornadoes and other impacts will be possible in our local area long after the center of the hurricane makes landfall in Louisiana as Ida is expected to turn north and ultimately northeast after landfall. Local impacts are detailed below:

- Tornadoes will be possible across the region Sunday evening, Sunday night, and into Monday. Please have a way to get urgent weather warnings!

- Heavy rain at times that could lead to flash flooding. The greatest chance of flash flooding will happen near the Alabama coast and over west Alabama.

- Wind gusts of 30-40 mph near the Alabama coast with breezy conditions (15-35 mph wind gusts) inland and across northwest Florida.

- Storm surge in Mobile Bay is currently expected to be in the 2-4 feet range. Storm surge near Dauphin Island and the Mississippi Sound of 4-7 feet may be possible. The more dangerous 7+ feet storm surge will likely happen to our west across parts of Mississippi and Louisiana.

- All coastal hazards, including dangerous rip currents, high waves, and even minor coastal flooding will be possible locally. One man passed away last evening due to rip currents near Opal Beach, FL near Navarre. Please stay out of the Gulf today and in the days ahead.

UPDATED: COULD THE PROJECTED PATH FOR IDA SHIFT EAST? Confidence continues to increase this morning that the core impacts associated with Hurricane Ida will happen to our southwest across parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. I understand many folks have anxiety about hurricanes, and rightfully so after our experiences with Sally and Zeta just last year. While impacts are expected from Hurricane Ida in our local area, the more extreme impacts are *extremely likely* to remain to our southwest. Unfortunately, this means that our friends in eastern Louisiana will take the brunt of this potentially devastating storm.

COULD IDA BECOME A CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE? Yes, but that is a technicality and something we all shouldn't get too hung up on. Why? Because whether a hurricane is a high-end, cat. 3, cat. 4, or cat. 5 storm really doesn't make that much difference. ALL of those categories produce life-threatening IMPACTS. The storm surge and wind damage in parts of eastern Louisiana could potentially be catastrophic, the likes of which have not been seen in that part of Louisiana since Hurricane Katrina or prior. Please don't get so fixated on the category that you forget about the key points: This is a major, potentially catastrophic storm for Eastern Louisiana, regardless of the specific category at landfall.

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS LOCALLY TODAY... Scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop this afternoon into this evening across south Alabama and northwest Florida. These areas of rain and thunderstorms are not directly associated with Ida. These storms are the classic, pop-up storms that develop just about everyday around our region in the summertime. Loud thunder, cloud-to-ground lightning, and heavy rain will be possible in the storms today. High temperatures will be in the upper-80s.

APP ALERTS... Many updates will be posted over the next few days in the RedZone Weather app. redzoneweather.com/app is the link for the free download. Be sure to visit the Alerts tab (bottom right corner) and tap the large, yellow “Alert Settings” button to customize the alerts you’d like to receive from me.

37735,"The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on recently upgraded Hurricane Ida, located over the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Isle of Youth - www.nhc.noaa.gov/#Ida

Elsewhere over the Atlantic basin on this Friday afternoon, an elongated area of low pressure is located over the central Atlantic several hundred miles east of Bermuda, producing disorganized showers and a couple of thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions 
are expected to be marginally conducive for development, however, a tropical depression could still form over the weekend.  The system is expected to drift eastward through tonight and Saturday, then accelerate northeastward Sunday toward the central north Atlantic. It has a medium (40 percent) chance of formation during the next 48 hours and a medium (60 percent) chance during the next five days.

There's a tropical wave located about midway between the Cabo Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, and the associated showers and thunderstorms have become a little better organized today.  Additional development of this system is expected, and a tropical depression is likely to form later tonight or Saturday before it moves into an environment of stronger upper-level winds and slightly cooler waters.  The disturbance is forecast to move west-northwestward through tonight, then turn northward Saturday. It has a high (80 percent) chance of formation during the next 48 hours and a high (80 percent) chance during the next five days.

Also, another tropical wave is expected to emerge off of the west African coast by the middle of next week.  Afterwards, environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for gradual development toward the end of next week as the system moves west-northwestward to northwestward at 10 to 15 mph. It has a near zero chance of formation during the next 48 hours and a low (20 percent) chance during the next five days. www.hurricanes.gov",0.03062413,0.0011587143,0.017485369,0.012722028,0.007301235,0.004069764

 Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Cuba through tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area across the Florida Keys on Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Florida beginning Saturday.

There will be a risk of isolated tornadoes beginning Saturday afternoon over parts of central and south Florida.

Interests in the Bahamas, elsewhere in Cuba, and the Florida Peninsula should monitor the progress of Fred.  Additional watches and warnings could be required for portions of these areas later today.  Interests in the Florida Panhandle should also monitor the progress of Fred. 

For storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office - www.weather.gov. For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.

At 11 a.m. EDT, the center of Tropical Depression Fred was located about 70 miles (115 km) north-northwest of Camaguey, Cuba, and about 270 miles (430 km) east-southeast of Key West, Florida. Fred is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue today. A turn toward the northwest is expected tonight or Saturday.  On the forecast track, Fred is expected to move along or near the north 
coast of central Cuba through tonight, be near the Florida Keys on Saturday, and move near or west of the west coast of the Florida peninsula Saturday night and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is expected today.  After that, slow strengthening is expected, and Fred could become a tropical storm again tonight or Saturday.

Fred is expected to produce the following rainfall amounts:
- Portions of Cuba...2 to 5 inches with isolated maximum totals of 8 inches. This rainfall may lead to scattered flash flooding.
- Across the Bahamas...1 to 3 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 5 inches.
- Today through Monday, 3 to 7 inches of rain is anticipated across the Keys, southern and central Florida north towards the Big Bend, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches. Heavy rainfall could lead to areal, urban, and small stream flooding, and potentially worsen
ongoing minor to isolated moderate river flooding over northern Florida.
- From Sunday onward, heavy rain and flood impacts could extend into inland portions of the Southeast and into the southern and central Appalachians and Piedmont as Fred interacts with a front in the area.

Sur le dépassement de la Terre

Après une légère amélioration l’an dernier, due à la pandémie, la consommation du monde reprend son cours normal. Et c’est de nouveau à la fin juillet que la planète a mangé tout son pain blanc industriel pour l’année — les mois à suivre sont une dépense sans ressources et sans capital, engagée sur crédit auprès d’une banque qui ne pardonne ni à la banquise, ni aux ours blancs, ni à la couche d’ozone, ni aux océans plastifiés, ni aux rivières pourries, ni aux forêts déforestées, ni au bidonville global, ni aux pauvres hommes et à leurs pauvres enfants. Les savants hurlent, mais il ne sort pas grand bruit de leur bouche béante, comme dans les cauchemars. Et même quand les plus audacieux d’entre eux osent mettre en cause la croissance, la plupart de leurs avertissements s’arrêtent au seuil de la croissance démographique, à quoi se résument pourtant tous les désastres en cours. On ne le répétera jamais assez, d’autant que personne ne paraît vouloir l’entendre : tant que l’augmentation globale de la population de la Terre ne sera pas maîtrisée et renversée, toutes les autres dispositions à prétention “écologique” ne seront que démonstrations inutiles, mesures d’accompagnement du rien.

Où que ce soit les politiques natalistes sont une folie. Les peuples qui doivent à leur sagesse la chance d’une raisonnable et progressive réduction en nombre de leurs individus se laissent ravir cet avantage par la submersion migratoire imposée. Le pire crime du remplacisme global davocratique — en sa course effrénée à toujours plus de consommateurs, sa fin suprême — est de procéder au remplacement systématique des peuples à faible taux de reproduction, objets d’un véritable génocide par substitution, par des populations à la croissance quantitative échevelée.

Extrait (d'une entrée ""spéculative"", il en est d'autres d'un tout autre genre) :

« Plieux, mercredi 18 mars 2020, onze heures moins vingt, le soir.

« Écrire, c’est toujours aller trop loin, quitte à en revenir aussitôt (ou pas aussitôt). Le style, comme le sens, a besoin d’arêtes vives, qui attirent le regard, excitent l’imagination, s’offrent immédiatement à la mémoire, pour celui qui les produit comme pour celui qui les reçoit. Héraclite, Pascal et Nietzsche, les trois plus grands stylistes de la pensée, exagèrent toujours un peu, à la façon de la foudre. Ils sculptent, en accentuant deux ou trois traits, et en enlevant tout ce qui pourrait nuire à ela silhouette générale de l’idée. Ils ne tiennent pas plus que cela au fond tel quel de ce qu’ils ont exprimé, sans doute : ils savent bien qu’il faudrait y apporter des nuances, y incorporer des objections, lester le tout de quelque contrepoint. Mais ils savent aussi, et c’est ce qui fait leur génie, qu’il fallait rque ce fût dit, et que ce le fût comme cela l’a été, quitte à ce que quelque universitaire, ensuite, vienne remettre les choses à leur place en note de bas de page, dans l’édition de la Pléiade. Leur rôle à eux est de fabriquer une monnaie, qui puisse servir aux échanges, dans l’âme ou dans la pensée, dans la rêverie ou wl’histoire, entre les heures et les peuples, entre les “forces en présence”. Il faut marquer un peu la ligne. Ils dépassent un peu leur pensée, et ils se gardent bien de l’atteindre jamais. Comme le répète Machin-Truc, non sans exagération, ce qui est profond en eux c’est le style, pas le fond. D’ailleurs il n’y a pas de fond.

« On écrit des livres pour en finir avec ce que l’on pense, pour n’être plus importuné par l’idée qui y préside. Voilà, ça c’est fait, c’est dit, on peut maintenant passer à autre chose. On ne passe jamais tout à fait à autre chose, naturellement. Je ne fais en aucune façon allusion à une quelconque insincérité, ici. Écrire c’est construire un mur, édifier une clôture pour le jardin, bâtir dans un paysage aimé une maison qu’on sera libre, ensuiter, d’habiter ou pas.

« Rien n’est pénétrant et juste comme l’épigraphe de Barthes aux Fragments d’un discours amoureux : « C’est donc un amoureux qui parle et qui dit : ». On peut ici remplacer le substantif par n’importe quel autre : paranoïaque, vieux facho, révolutionnaire, vaniteux, imbécile, génie, salopard, séducteur, délicat, mort, etc.e Toute phrase naît guillemetée. La syntaxe elle-même est une paire de guillemets. Cette idée doit vraiment m’être consubstantielle car sa plus ancienne formulation remonte en moi à l’enfance :

« Je vois des opinions qui passent et je pourrais les prendre, comme des autobus » (je songeais à ceux de Clermont-Ferrand, sans nul doute). »

46946,"« Il y a d’abord ce titre, ""Âme qui vive"", le plus beau, peut-être, depuis celui de ""Septembre absolu"", en 2011. Âme qui vive aurait pu constituer, pour une anthologie de l’œuvre de Renaud Camus, un titre parfait. Il est celui de ce Journal pour l’année 2020 et convient à merveille à son contenu, souvent spectral et paradoxalement teinté d’une gaieté et d’une légèreté de ton encore plus présente que dans les volumes précédents.

« Âme qui vive. D’aucuns traduiront ce titre par ""personne"", ""absence"", ""pas d’âme"" ou ""pas de vie"". Tout lecteur sensible de Renaud Camus y lira au contraire : âme, vie, présence (au monde). 

« L’année commence par l’annonce de la mort de W., personnage essentiel de la vie amoureuse passée de Camus (et dont l’ombre n’a cessé de planer sur son œuvre depuis lors) et se termine par celle du chien Vidocq, dont les vieux jours ont offert aux lecteurs de Renaud Camus quelques pages sublimes : ""il avait en horreur l’extérieur, le ciel ouvert, l’air libre, le jardin. Les seuls moments où on le voyait pris d’une animation quelconque, mais alors assez vive, et très surprenante, étaient ceux où il comprenait qu’il allait pouvoir rentrer, passer la porte, gravir à grand-peine l’escalier, regagner la pièce que nous lui avions allouée.""

« Au cours de cette année 2020, Renaud Camus est touché par une forme grave du Coronavirus. À l’hôpital, son cœur cesse de battre à plusieurs reprises. Cette expérience interrompt de façon inédite la rédaction du Journal pendant plusieurs semaines, mais est relatée, par lambeaux bouleversants, dès que l’auteur de Passage retrouve assez de force pour reprendre la plume. ""Plus on aime l’autre, plus sa souffrance est insupportable. On a beau s’en défendre, on lui en veut de geindre comme il fait, de vous infliger la contrariété de ne pouvoir rien pour lui. On en viendrait facilement à le soupçonner de surjouer le supplice, préférant encore l’envisager en comédien qu’en martyr. Lui reste seul, comme on meurt.""

« La mort, il faut l’écrire, est très présente dans ce Journal 2020 : celle du fidèle ami, Philippe Martel, ""Votre image et l’idée de vous ne quittent guère mon esprit chagriné"", celle de Jean Raspail, également. Pourtant, la lecture d’Âme qui vive est gaie. Le style de Renaud Camus est comme toujours léger ; faire l’éloge de son style en évitant l’abus de superlatifs est d’ailleurs une gageure, il faudrait ne procéder que par citations : ""J’ai dû dire d’où je venais, et ce que je voulais – rien"". Voilà, tout Camus est dans cette phrase, d’une simplicité parfaite et d’une beauté incomparable. L’humour affleure en permanence, on se surprend à rire de bon cœur, à plusieurs reprises : « quatre ou cinq des hommes et des femmes commis à l’accueil se regardaient les uns les autres comme si je m’étais adressé à eux en poldave ou en moyen-finnois. Je n’ai fait qu’aggraver mon cas en brodant comme je pouvais, espérant qu’un ou deux de mes mots pourraient rencontrer par hasard une quelconque terre d’accueil, dans le regard de mes interlocuteurs. »

« Les difficiles combats judiciaires, politiques et éditoriaux occupent, naturellement, une place importante dans ce volume, de même que les rêveries immobilières avortées, mais Camus semble n’avoir jamais autant aimé la vie, malgré la constance de ses insuccès (publics).

« Il faut lire Renaud Camus. Notre époque serait impardonnable si elle n’offrait pas enfin le succès à cet immense auteur. »

The North with no single barrel of crude oil are controlling the NNPC. Yet, the poorest of the poor are in the North and the poverty is spreading very fast and soon it will consume the South. A minority in the North with a population of less than 7 million is controlling your future and that of your children unborn. When they say to you ''One Nigeria''  - they are actually preparing you and your generation for complete destruction. This is not a mere rhetoric -  it is a stark reality and they are not in any form hiding it. This is why Nigerians in the South -  with all the acclaimed education are the most stupid and foolish people on earth.

L'ouvrage majeur de Renaud Camus, le “Dictionnaire des délicatesses du français contemporain”, vient de paraître aux Éditions “Chez l'auteur“ : https://www.renaudcamus-librairie.com/

Manuel du ”bien parler"" et du ”bien écrire”, guide de la phrase bien charpentée, recueil malicieux des fautes commises par les journalistes (et par nous-mêmes) : le Dictionnaire des délicatesses du français contemporain est une œuvre indispensable pour tous ceux qui souhaitent améliorer leur langue. 

Il y a vingt ans, Renaud Camus publiait chez P.O.L un ""Répertoire des délicatesses du français contemporain"". Le présent dictionnaire en double la taille (839 pages, en deux volumes). Il comprend notamment les définitions de tous les grands concepts chers à l'auteur (“nocence“, “remplacisme“, “Matière Humaine Indifférenciée“, etc.).

Extrait (article ""souci"") : 

« souci. Je m’aperçois qu’à l’époque du ""Répertoire des délicatesses"", il y a quinze ans, je n’avais même pas ressenti le besoin d’insérer dans le livre un article ""souci"". C’est sans doute que ce mot-là n’avait pas encore, alors, commencé sa seconde carrière, qui fut retentissante, qui l’est encore un peu, mais qui paraît entrée, tout de même, dans sa phase déclinante. Néanmoins, aujourd’hui même, j’entendais à la radio, M. Matthieu Potte-Bonneville, philosophe, déclarer tout à fait sans rire, à propos d’un ouvrage de Mme Geneviève Fraisse :

 « Le livre a tout de même une position arbitrale qui à l’occasion me pose souci » (France Culture, 26 novembre 2014).

« S’il n’y avait pas dans le ""Répertoire"" d’article ""souci"" il ne pouvait pas ne pas y avoir d’article ""poser problème"", expression qui fut l’un des étendards intellectuels de toute une époque. ""Souci"" ayant pris la place de problème, il est tout à fait normal que le ridicule ""poser problème"" ait été remplacé par le plus ridicule encore ""poser souci"". ""Souci"" étant à son tour bousculé, dans l’acception de problème, par l’absurde ""sujet"" (le sujet, c’est que…), il faut s’attendre qu’à poser souci succède, dans la faveur des mêmes cercles, un improbable ""poser sujet"".

« Le souci, longtemps (je laisse de côté la fleur du même nom), n’a eu d’existence que dans l’esprit ou l’âme des individus. C’était un sentiment, une humeur, l’un et l’autre négatifs et plutôt sombres. On éprouvait un souci, autant dire une inquiétude, un agacement, une préoccupation, voire une angoisse. Cependant il serait faux de dire que le mot, déjà, et dès la langue classique, n’était pas passé du côté de la cause de ce qu’il désignait, du motif de l’inquiétude en question ; mais c’était toujours en liaison étroite avec l’esprit ou le cœur de celui ou de celle qui ressentait. Au XVIIe siècle, avant que le mot ne se fatigue vers 1700 comme le signale Littré, le domaine amoureux était son champ d’exercice constant. Passé du sentiment (la préoccupation, l’obsession) à sa cause, souci désignait volontiers l’objet d’amour. De “vous faites mon souci” on avait glissé facilement à “vous êtes mon souci”, “mon cher souci”, “mon seul souci”, “mon beau souci”. Le souci en ce sens-là était généralement une personne mais pouvait être aussi bien une entité abstraite. « Beauté, mon beau souci », écrit notoirement Malherbe, auquel Larbaud, trois siècles plus tard, empruntera le titre d’un de ses meilleurs récits. »

Retrouvant dans mon propre langage les scies, les fautes et les bêtises qu'il relève, j'étais partagé entre une vague honte et l'envie de rire de moi-même ; Renaud Camus fait de la stylistique au plus traditionnel du terme : comment bien parler, bien écrire. Ce genre de guide nous manque cruellement... Ses intuitions satiriques, son regard amusé sur nos mots, rééduquent le lecteur et le rendent à jamais incapable de prendre au sérieux la prose d'un théâtreux engagé, d'un journaliste du Monde ou d'un critique du Magazine littéraire.

Extrait (article ""insulter"") : 

« insulter. “'Nabil, arrête !' : à Reims une jeune fille tabassée et insultée de 'pétasse'“ (Valeurs actuelles, 9 septembre 2020).

« Certaines nouveautés paraissent d’abord tellement invraisemblables, si impossible à croire, si bizarres et tellement énormes dans leur agressif caractère inédit, qu’on ne parvient pas à se convaincre qu’elles sont bien apparues et qu’on n’imagine pas un instant qu’elles puissent se maintenir sérieusement dans la langue : elles sont une farce qui ne durera pas. Or, à peine ont elles jailli de l’idiolecte des jeunes des quartiers, on les reconnaît avec stupéfaction dans celui des ministres, et dans celui des dames d’œuvre. Ainsi du très étonnant chassé-croisé entre les verbes insulter, transitif direct, et traiter, traiter de, transitif indirect. Non seulement on les dirait interchangeables, alors qu’ils se construisent de façon très différente et n’ont pas le même sens, mais on jurerait qu’ils se sont amusés à échanger leurs défroques, à se remplacer réciproquement. Jadis on insultait les gens en les traitant de collaborateurs ou de vendus, à présent on les traite, tout court, en les insultant de pouffiasse, ou de sale Français.

“M’sieur y a Yacine i’ m’a traitée.”

”J’me suis fait insulter de raciste.”

« La quasi-naturalisation, en quelques années, de ce chassé-croisé pour eux stupéfiant laisse éberlués les usagers traditionnels de la langue, et ils n’arrivent à se départir de la conviction d’avoir affaire à une mauvaise plaisanterie, de la trompeuse assurance qu’ils ne peuvent pas entendre sérieusement ce qu’ils entendent, de la certitude qu’on les fait marcher, malgré leur grand âge. Mais :

“Un élève insulte ses camarades de 'fils de porcs', sa mère le défend et menace un #enseignant (Valeurs actuelles, 23 octobre 2020).”

« Il se pourrait que se moquer suivît le même chemin qu’insulter, et en vînt comme lui à se construire comme traiter :

47474,"✍🏼 Retrouvez ma tribune sur notre contre-projet sur l'islamisme ⤵️
 
Le projet de loi dit « séparatisme » a été adopté en première lecture ce mardi 16 février 2021. Ayant œuvré à l’élaboration du contre-projet de loi présenté par les députés du Rassemblement National, j’aimerais répondre à certaines interrogations soulevées par nos adversaires, qui semblent ne pas vouloir comprendre ce que contient notre texte.
 
Le premier argument qui nous a été opposé est que notre contre-projet serait « inconstitutionnel ». C’est inexact. Notre contre-projet de loi vise à répondre à l’enjeu vital du séparatisme islamiste qui divise notre société. Il ne porte nullement atteinte à la liberté de conscience. Nous sommes attachés à la défense des libertés publiques et des droits fondamentaux ; socle d’une démocratie libérale dans laquelle les idées politiques, les croyances religieuses, les convictions philosophiques, et, de manière plus générale, les opinions personnelles, sont plurielles. Leur expression est libre et protégée. Toutefois, la liberté de conscience, seule liberté dont le champ d’application n’est pas délimité par la loi, peut trouver des restrictions dans sa manifestation publique. Notamment quand la manifestation d’une opinion personnelle peut troubler l’ordre et la sécurité publics, la tranquillité de tous. C’est l’article 10 de la déclaration des droits de l’homme de 1789.
 
La Convention de sauvegarde des droits de l’Homme et des libertés fondamentales n’en dit pas moins au deuxième paragraphe de son article 9, que je me permets de reproduire ici: « La liberté de manifester sa religion ou ses convictions ne peut faire l’objet d’autres restrictions que celles qui, prévues par la loi, constituent des mesures nécessaires, dans une société démocratique, à la sécurité publique, à la protection de l’ordre, de la santé ou de la morale publiques, ou à la protection des droits et libertés d’autrui. » Notre contre-projet ne vise pas à interdire l’opinion islamiste, nul ne pouvant être contraint en son for intérieur, mais bien à réduire sa manifestation dans l’espace public. La nuance est de taille.
 
Ce que nous voulons prohiber n’est donc pas le fait d’avoir des convictions islamistes. La loi doit en revanche pouvoir dire explicitement que l’islamisme, par sa nature même, mène une guerre contre la France dans le projet avoué de dominer notre pays, d’en changer les mœurs et les lois. C’est précisément, du reste, ce que recouvre le terme de « séparatisme » avancé par le gouvernement. L’islamisme comprend d’ailleurs, dans sa vision du monde, des valeurs irréconciliables avec les principes libéraux qui sont les murs porteurs de notre droit, de nos institutions politiques, jusqu’à notre civilisation.
 
Ainsi, le droit islamique que les islamistes entendent appliquer littéralement, comprend des règles en opposition avec notre Ordre public, le droit de la famille étant régulièrement cité comme l’une de ces principales pommes de discorde. Les filiations sont, par exemple, traitées inégalement. Plus grave encore, les personnes n’ont pas les mêmes droits et y sont discriminées en fonction de leur sexe ou de leurs confessions religieuses, ces règles islamiques ayant des incidences en matière fiscale, civile ou encore pénale.
 
Le principal grief que l’on peut formuler à l’encontre du projet de loi séparatisme de Gérald Darmanin est donc qu’il ne désigne pas plus le phénomène qu’il n’entend combattre ses manifestations. La loi prend le risque de réduire les libertés de tous pour contrer les ennemis de la liberté que sont les islamistes. C’est une erreur fondamentale, majeure. En tant que défenseurs des libertés publiques et des droits fondamentaux, nous jugeons que s’attaquer très directement aux ennemis de la liberté permet de protéger les libertés de l’ensemble de la société. La diffusion des idées islamistes n’entre pas dans le cadre de la divergence d’opinions, ces derniers ne proposant in fine pas autre chose qu’une sécession pure et simple avec la communauté nationale. Séparation qui ne saurait être tolérée s’ils persistaient à vouloir vivre sur le territoire national.
 
Les islamistes sont les premiers à stigmatiser la religion musulmane, leurs agissements associant tristement l’ensemble des croyants de cette religion à leur projet politique. Raison pour laquelle la loi doit définir l’islamisme comme étant une idéologie prohibée, ce que s’attache à faire notre contre-projet en donnant les caractéristiques détaillées qui la rendent incompatible avec notre État de droit. La première condition nécessaire et préalable est que cette pratique entraîne l’existence d’un trouble à l’ordre et à la paix publics. Les dernières années nous ont tout de même enseigné que l’islamisme provoquait des divisions au sein de la communauté nationale, incitant des Français à se séparer de la communauté nationale en partant au djihad au Moyen-Orient, en commettant des attentats en France, en discriminant les femmes, en portant le (truncated)",0.20265625,0.0104522705,0.0623257,0.10735235,0.09623027,0.18235919

The biggest losers if Nigeria breaks up 

Argument
The idea of having a near-perfect country out of a ruptured Nigeria is illusory. The composite parts of the country each contribute to the miasma of confusion that Nigeria is. No single entity is responsible for Nigeria’s problems. All the ethnic nationalities are equal shareholders in the failing of the Nigerian enterprise. There is enough blame to go around.

Splintering the entity has often been exalted as the remedy to Nigeria’s problems. But this is a defective reasoning because in this instance, Nigeria is defined by its geography and not its people. Nigeria is its people. It is the same people that will occupy the emergent states not angels. There is no paradise anywhere. The problem with Nigeria is a people-problem. Recalibrating the map will not change anything – if the minds of the people do not conform to progressive values.

The assumption that there will be ‘’divine concordance’’ if Nigeria breaks up according to regional lines is obtuse. That a people speak a common language does not put a stamp of camaraderie on group relationship. In the south-east for instance, there is native discrimination among people of the same region. Some are regarded as ‘’impure Igbo breeds’’ while others consider themselves as ‘’true Igbo scions’’. There are areas sons of certain states are advised not to tread in search of love. Also, it is quotidian among the Igbo to describe people from certain areas in Ebonyi with the pejorative of ‘’wah awah’’ – ‘’impure breeds’’. And there is a deep gulf among classes on the social ladder in the region.
So, what will change if, for example, there is a south-east state as some are campaigning for? Will the present social order be inverted? Will the internecine hate and wrangling dissipate? Well, for sure I think the current revulsion that some have for the entity ‘’Nigeria’’ will be reserved for the emergent state. Elite corruption and abuse will still dominate the polity because the new order will be from the same predatory gene-pool. Non-ethnic predation will give way for ethnic predation because at the end of day class struggle is not resolved by the unity of language, religion or culture. 

There is a classic example of a country in Africa steeped in economic and civil crisis after breaking away from the motherboard. The case of oil-rich South-Sudan rings a familiar bell. Today, South-Sudan is one of the poorest countries on the surface of the earth despite its oil wealth. All the hoopla and gyrations that followed the country’s severance from Sudan soon gave way for tears, sorrow and blood.

As of 2019, 400,000 citizens have been killed in the South-Sudan crisis. Four million refugees created and 1.8 million people internally displaced. The cause of these tragedies boils down to power struggle among the elite who quickly mobilised themselves behind the emergent state to capture power. A country fabled to be a lodestar in Africa and which was to be a compelling argument for splintering ‘’artificially created’’ states on the continent is now a functional example of why breaking up countries in Africa is not expedient.

An often parroted argument for Nigeria’s dissolution is that the country is an inorganic fabrication of the British. True, but so are many countries on the planet, yet they are thriving and working according to a common purpose. Most countries in the world were created by accidents of history. It is nearly impossible to find a homogenous country. The problem with Nigeria, as we all know, is that we are yet to have a people’s leadership or as Chinua Achebe puts it, a leader “humbled by the trust placed on him by the people’’ and ‘’willing to use the power given to him for the good of the people’’.

We are stronger together. This is not a platitude but a fact. 90 percent of the wealth of the Igbo is not warehoused in the south-east. The Igbo are a peripatetic people gifted with extraordinary entrepreneurial abilities. They are among the most financially fortunate Nigerians. Nigeria and beyond are their trading arcade. They are in every nook, cranny and crevices in the country. It is unarguable that a united Nigeria is a more viable emporium for the Igbo than a fragmented Nigeria. It will not be the same for the business-minded Igbo with new states emerging from the wreck of Nigeria – the emergent states will certainly want to put up hedges that will protect their own people against outsiders.

Ces deux journalistes sont sensés être des ""spécialistes de l'extrême-droite"". Leur angle d'attaque n'a pas changé d'un pouce : ne pas lire Renaud Camus, le forcer à rentrer dans leur très grossière case ""extrême-droite"", et prétendre qu'il n'y a rien là de nouveau. L'article est indigne, mais il est aussi diffamatoire — ce qui nous oblige à répondre. 

1/ Ils prêtent à Renaud Camus des propos qu'ils n'a jamais eu (il présenterait les musulmans comme des ""guerriers envahisseurs"", ce qui est diffamatoire, et met sa vie en danger). 

2/ Ils affirment que le ""Grand Remplacement"" est une ""théorie pseudo-scientifique"" : or Renaud Camus s'est toujours refusé à se placer sur le terrain des chiffres, de la statistiques, des sciences. Il suffit d'ouvrir ""Le Grand Remplacement"", ou de lire l'une de ses nombreuses interviews, ou regarder au hasard un entretien filmé sur Youtube (https://youtu.be/pRcS4kx8qWU pour s'en apercevoir.

3/ Ils affirment que le ""Grand Remplacement"", qui n'existe pas, est une théorie ancienne, que Renaud Camus n'a fait que reprendre. C'est totalement faux. Leur généalogie est purement ""ad hoc"" ; c'est une façon de dire ""circulez, il n'y a rien à voir, c'est une obsession de méchants racistes"". 

(Il y a eu un maigre progrès, toutefois : ils ne prétendent plus que l'expression même de ""Grand Remplacement"" a été utilisée par les nazis ou les fascistes...)

Les avocats de Renaud Camus ne sont pas mécontents de cet appel — pour bien des raisons. Le marathon judiciaire se poursuit : Procès d'Auch dans dix jours, Procès Schiappa dans 3 semaines.

Sur le procès Camus / Procureur, LICRA, UEJF, AIPJ, SOS Racisme, DILCRAH

Nous ne pouvons que nous féliciter de la relaxe de M. Renaud Camus, décidée le 10 février 2021 par la XVIIe chambre du Tribunal de Paris. Tandis que nous devions avoir le Procureur pour seul adversaire, six (!) associations « antiracistes » ont tenté de nous prendre d’assaut en se présentant à l’audience. En vain. Quatre heures de plaidoiries présidées avec impartialité, 22.500 € d’indemnisations diverses et d’amende sollicités, 4 mois de prison avec sursis requis, des accusations fantaisistes et surabondantes — toutes ces prétentions ont été écartées & rejetées par le jugement. Ce procès aura aussi été l’occasion de mettre un fait constant sous la lumière la plus crue : ces associations ignorent tout de Renaud Camus et de son œuvre. Celles-ci devront rendre compte de leurs actions et des persécutions auxquelles elles se livrent illégitimement, ne serait-ce qu’au nom de l’argent public qu’elles reçoivent en quantité chaque année.

48656,"Outrepas, journal 2002, extrait de l'entrée du dimanche 24 novembre : 

« Flatters paraphrasant Godard, résume très efficacement la situation : ""le pouvoir, c’est le montage."" Celui qui procède au montage, en effet, non seulement a le pouvoir évident d’empêcher celui qui parle de dire ce qu’il dit, et dont le monteur ne veut pas que ce soit dit, mais ce détenteur du pouvoir de montage peut aussi contraindre sa victime à paraître dire ce qu’elle ne dit pas, ou du moins à  sembler acquiescer à des opinions  ou à des expressions auxquelles elle n’acquiescent en aucune façon.

[…]

En règle générale, cependant, ce qu’il coupe est ce qui le dessert lui-même. Et ce qu’il monte en épingle, c’est tout ce qui m’abat. Tous les coups que j’ai encaissés sont soigneusement cadrés, étalés, largement orchestrés. Tout ceux que j’ai pu marquer sont gommés, au contraire, effacés, rendus insoupçonnables. Bien entendu l’allusion que j’ai faite à le censure, à propos de l’intervention d’Élisabeth Lévy, en ma faveur, lundi dernier sur Paris Première, a été rigoureusement censurée. Censurée aussi ma vive réplique à propos de la nécessité prétendue d’une importation de ""chair fraîche"" au bénéfice de l’industrie. Censurée mon évocation du droit des peuples, qu’ils soient kurde ou tibétain.

Finkielkraut est mis hors de lui par le terme de réparation qui a été utilisé par Ardisson., mercredi dernier, au téléphone, pour me convaincre de paraître à son émission d’hier, laquelle aurait constituée pour moi, selon l’animateur, une réparation aux avanies qui m’avaient été infligées sur Paris Première, avec la suppression de l’entretien entre Élisabeth Lévy et moi – Pierre, maintenant que j’y pense, était indigné mercredi par ce mot de réparation, et jugeait qu’une invitation à cet horrible ""Tout le monde en parle"" ne saurait en aucune façon être considéré comme un cadeau ou un bienfait, encore moins comme une réparation pour un méfait. Selon Finkielkraut, la volonté de nuire était évidente, en tout cas. Et quand la volonté de nuire, téléguidée ou non, est celle d’un animateur-présentateur qui, par sa maîtrise absolue du montage, a tous les moyens de vous laisser dire que ce qui peut vous desservir, il n’y a guère de moyen de lui résister. 

La vérité est probablement qu’Ardisson avait été très déçu d’avoir en quelque sorte raté son coup sur Paris Première, la première fois ; de n’avoir pas réussi à m’abattre, et de m’avoir vu, même, recevoir le soutien d’Élisabeth Lévy, qui n’était certainement pas ce qu’il attendait d’elle : non seulement il ne m’avait pas écrasé, ainsi qu’il avait peut-être reçu pour mission de le faire (de son grand ami BHL ?) ; mais en plus je m’en tirais avec les honneurs de la guerre, ou peu s’en faut. D’où la nécessité de censurer EL, d’abord, et de se donner une deuxième chance contre moi, en m’invitant, sous couvert de réparation, à ""Tout le monde en parle"", où ma déconfiture serait encore plus publique, et plus facile à assurer grâce à l’expérience de mon système de défense, combinée avec la maîtrise du montage : ah, sale mouche, tu m’as échappé contre ce carreau-là, je ne vais pas te manquer contre cette vitre-ci… […] »

Quelques nouvelles de Twitter, où vient de se dérouler une petite affaire merveilleuse, en ce qu'elle expose parfaitement la nature des attaques portées contre Camus.

Ce matin, un journaliste de ""Libération"" et de ""Slate"", Pierre Plottu, a fait une lecture à contre-sens d'un tweet de Renaud Camus.

Plottu : « Régulièrement l'idéologue d'extrême droite Renaud Camus (vulgarisateur de cette théorie fumeuse du ""grand remplacement"" qui justifie le pire) prétend qu'il n'est pas antisémite. Le reste du temps : »

[Il cite alors un tweet de Renaud Camus : ]

« Parler de la ""théorie"" du Grand Remplacement"", c'est comme parler de la ""théorie des chambres à gaz"". »

Réponse de Camus : 

« Ce tweet de ce M. Pierre Plottu est évidemment une abomination mais avant cela c’est une merveille. Toute l’intellection journalistique est là. La haine d’abord. C’est la haine qui est chargée de comprendre. Et naturellement elle comprend exactement à l’envers. »
[...]
« En effet, c’est merveilleux. On tient là la carcasse, la structure réduite à l’os, de tout un système de lecture systématiquement à l’envers, qui veut faire passer pour négationniste l’antinégationnisme le plus radical et pour néonazi l’antitotalitarisme fondamental. »

Et que s'est-il passé ensuite ? Twitter a supprimé le tweet originel... de Camus.

« Du coup le tweet, Le MIEN, a été retiré de Twitter, qui avalise donc, sur sa dénonciation, l’abominable interprétation plottuvienne. Est-ce donc Plottu qu’il faut poursuivre, ou Twitter (devant des juges entièrement plottuviens (ou plottuïques, je ne sais jamais) ???? »

Le général Martinez a écrit ceci, en réponse à Pierre Plottu : 

« Votre tweet est non seulement stupide mais ignoble. Votre haine de ceux qui ""ne pensent pas comme il faut"" vous conduit à comprendre l'inverse de ce qui est écrit par Renaud Camus. Le Grand Remplacement n'est pas une théorie, c'est un constat, un fait comme les chambres à gaz. 

Mais la subtilité de Renaud Camus vous échappe totalement. Ou peut-être vous agace-t-elle tellement, parce qu'elle renforce la compréhension de la réalité, que vous ne supportez pas de devoir reconnaître cette dernière.

Enfin, si vous ne voulez pas le voir, plus d'un habitant sur cinq et d'une naissance sur trois dans notre pays sont aujourd'hui d'origine extra-européenne. Votre rôle de journaliste devrait vous inciter, sans haine et avec un minimum d'objectivité, à en tirer quelques conclusions. »",0.11119666,0.0023460388,0.06953252,0.017367685,0.0073918556,0.011543332

La meilleure solution, c'est l'achat de crédits de lecture ici : https://renaud-camus.net/livres-et-textes-en-ligne/. L’auteur percevra 95% du prix de vente. L'argent fait défaut : les tribunaux réclameront bientôt de nouveau des milliers d'euros, et malgré l'aide bénévole de la bibliothèque, le travail est de plus en plus difficile, surtout par une température de 14°c DANS le château.

Le célèbre ""journal"" a longtemps été publié chez Fayard, avant que tous les éditeurs ne s'enfuient. Pour 40€, vous pouvez le lire en ligne, une nouvelle entrée étant publiée chaque jour : https://renaud-camus.net/journal/

Certaines œuvres ont été conçues pour être directement lues en ligne, comme les Vaisseaux Brûlés, hypertexte fascinant, folle entreprise de dévoilement absolue : https://renaud-camus.net/vaisseaux-brules/presentation/

Les Petit et Grand Remplacements sont, eux aussi, accessibles sur https://renaud-camus.net/livres-et-textes-en-ligne/t/29/Le-Petit-Remplacement. Si vous voulez comprendre quelque chose au combat décolonial, au combat pour la civilisation du livre, c'est là que vous devez vous rendre.

L'œuvre de Renaud Camus est tissée de mille autres aspects : églogues, élégies, romans, théâtre, poésie, peinture, photographie, topographie, critique d'art, chroniques, etc.

Il y parvient parfaitement et il y a chez lui des accents de vérité (excusez le mot) qui vont bien au-delà de ce que beaucoup d'autres diaristes ont tenté d'enregistrer. » 

« Lire un seul volume de ce ""grand"" journal est insuffisant. Il faut se pencher sur la totalité des volumes qui ne sont pas tous de même intérêt certes ; mais et tout lire. Renaud Camus raconte tout ; cela donne la sensation de se lire soi, de se voir vivre soi, d'avoir devant soi son double, son jumeau. Les écrits de Renaud Camus sont bien au-delà de ce qui fut ""L'affaire RC"" ; c'est du grand bonheur littéraire d'être à ses côtés, et les heures passées en sa compagnie ne sont jamais perdues. »

Communiqué du Rassemblement National ⤵️

Face à l’aggravation de la situation sanitaire, le ministre de la Santé a annoncé le 23 septembre le classement du territoire en trois zones auxquelles s’appliquent de nouvelles mesures de restriction.

S’agissant des zones « d’alerte maximale », le Gouvernement a annoncé la fermeture totale des bars et restaurants dès samedi.

Le Rassemblement National s’interroge sur la proportionnalité et l’efficacité d’une telle mesure alors que le secteur de la restauration, conscient des enjeux sanitaires pour la clientèle et le personnel ,a appliqué dès le déconfinement un protocole sanitaire très strict (distance entre les clients, port du masque par le personnel, utilisation massive du gel hydroalcoolique, extension des terrasses). Il s’interroge également sur les éléments dont dispose le gouvernement pour affirmer que ce secteur d’activité présente des risques de contamination plus élevés qu’un autre secteur ou la sphère familiale.

Alors que ces nouvelles restrictions vont avoir des conséquences économiques et sociales lourdes pour ce secteur déjà durement éprouvé, le Rassemblement National demande au gouvernement de communiquer à la profession, qui demeure en pleine incertitude, les mesures qu’il entend prendre afin de l’indemniser à la suite des décisions administratives de fermeture prises pendant le confinement.

Face aux enjeux, le Rassemblement National, en cas de maintien de cette mesure, demande à ce qu’une évaluation économique et sanitaire soit réalisée dès la fin de la première semaine d’application.

Il est rappelé que seule une accélération de l’accès aux tests de dépistage et surtout une communication rapide des résultats permettront une lutte efficace contre cette pandémie.",0.019603057,0.0010204315,0.01617693,0.01309778,0.0055551752,0.0016186562

55903,"My angry reaction earlier today on One Nigeria nonsense

By: Prof (Amb)George Obiozor. 

Most of the Diasporans here live in Europe. Can you show me one multi-ethnic state in Europe where one group is positioned to dominate the rest that hasn't broken up?

For those who may not know, what you call ethnic groups in Nigeria are called nations in Europe.

There's nowhere in the world where the white man accepts domination from another white man in perpetuity.

It used to be so under the Roman empire and the like. Not anymore. The Communists tried it, dividing society into capitalists and proletariats, deluding themselves that ethnicity is effectively swept under the carpet, but what followed? The Communist edifices in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia,  and the big brother, USSR, all collapsed, while the two Germans that are ethnically the same but split by communism vs capitalism were reunited. Such is the power of ethnic nationalism.

Czechoslovakia was made up of two ethnic groups,  the Czech and the Slovakians. Both separated peacefully on 1st January 1993. The former is today 10.6 million people and the latter 5.4 million. Added together,  they're not up to Lagos. Yet, they split for peace. Two masters can't be in the same house.

Yugoslavia in 1991 was 23.2 million, barely more than Lagos population. It broke into six countries same year - all along ethnic lines, namely: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, 
Macedonia, Montenegro,
 Serbia, and Slovenia.

Then the big brother, USSR. It had, at least, the following ethnic groups identified by their languages:

Regional languages:

Ukrainian

Belarusian

Uzbek

Kazakh

Georgian

Azerbaijani

Lithuanian

Moldavian

Latvian

Kyrgyz

Tajik

Armenian

Turkmen

Estonian

Minority languages:

Abkhaz

Bashkir

Buryat

Chechen

Finnish

Volga German

Korean

Ossetian

Tatar

& various others.

Today, your fingers will not be enough to count the number of countries that have emerged from the USSR.

Sit down there and be preaching unity in Nigeria as if you're the kindest gentleman on earth while you have no solution to the genocide in Southern Kaduna, the illegal but officially condoned arms in the hands of killer herdsmen roaming the country, and be condemning those better informed about the fact that the country is undergoing the strains of a forced union and should be peacefully restructured or let people go their separate ways.

In Europe, the two best examples of fairly stable multi-ethnic states are the UK and Switzerland.  The former is led by reasonable men who permitted regional autonomy to the Irish, the Scots and the Welsh, while the English dominate Westminster. That's something some of us are asking for, but you're fighting against it in your own country wracked by ethnic crisis. Your own people are better off under oppression of fellow black men because your people have bad leaders who can't do better than their new internal colonisers.

The latter country, Switzerland, has four ethnic groups. Each of them rotates the presidency annually through seven cantons that constitute the federation units. All the four languages of the four ethnic groups are recognized as official languages and school languages to boot, namely, German, French, Italian, and Romansch that has just a few thousand speakers!

There's nowhere in the world where the Caucasians allow the domination of their group by another.

In Canada, Quebec is the only full French-speaking province, aside a little section of New Brunswick.  The other seven provinces are English-speaking.  Yet, Canada is bilingual for the sake of Quebec! And each of the provinces is largely self-governing. 

Here we are in Nigeria,  you have people arguing vehemently that a decrepit,  structurally-flawed, and crisis-prone artificial contraption badly configured by the British only needs good people to survive. Why not centralise the powers of the British regions to London and see what happens?!

57974,"This is why I love the North — Arthur Eze

Prince Arthur Eze is an Igbo billionaire from Ukpo in Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State. Presented here is culled from the interview he granted to one of the National News media.

What’s your take on Igbo presidency come 2023?

The North loves Igbo and would be willing to work with Igbo for the 2023 presidency. I don’t care where the president comes from. During the time of President Jonathan, we had the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Pius Anyim. What did he do for Igbo people? He brought Julius Berger and they tarred his own road; the one leading to his house. All our roads were bad. It is President Buhari that is tarring our roads now.

Buhari is tarring Enugu – Onitsha Road, Enugu – Port Harcourt Road and completing Second Niger Bridge. He modernized Zik’s grave. Did Jonathan do that? 

These South-East governors, does any of them ask whether you eat or not? For example, in Anambra State, Dunukofia Local Government Area makes about N150 million every month. Has Governor Obiano built anything in Dunukofia? Has he brought any industry to Anambra? Tell me. Your children, where are they going to go tomorrow? Go to Yoruba land in Ogun, you will see industries. Go to Rivers and you’ll see industries.

For the Igbo to be President, they must love themselves. We must learn from Nnamdi Azikiwe. Zik was a wise man. During his time, he built bridges with the North through the Sardauna of Sokoto and Tafawa Balewa. The seed of discord between the North and Ndigbo should be broken totally so that both regions can enjoy harmonious relationship for the benefit of all. 

After civil war, Igbo properties were seized in Rivers and other areas, but the northerners didn’t seize anything. In fact, they returned all Igbo properties including money made from them. So, northerners are kind. 

The North helped me to establish my business.  Abubakar Rimi (second republic Kano governor) gave me $12 million for Kano TV in 1980 when I didn’t have one naira. He called Governor Lar and he gave me that of Plateau for $12 million. It was the same thing in Katsina, Borno and Kaduna. Then, they put me in oil business. They didn’t care where I came from. Tell me any Igbo man who can do that.

Remark

When we reported that Arthur Eze was playing the drum of his masters in the North, it was not an exaggeration. We deduced that from his own mouth. After reading his answers to the interviewer above, it is crystal clear that his allegiance is to the north. The Second Niger Bridge is almost non-existent. The roads are in unprecedented terribly state. He is praising Buhari for renovating Zik's grave, while unbelievably N185 billion was spent in the North to feed almajiris during this lockdown. Feeding school children when schools are not open yet! How can he speak for Igbo Nation?  It is high time he is told to speak for himself and to sit down when Igbo interest and freedom is discussed.",0.043399423,0.0014019012,0.023221988,0.015932998,0.006647474,0.005771666

Alors qu’une récente étude du CAT (Centre d’analyse du terrorisme), remise au Sénat, démontre que 60% des djihadistes, ressortissants ou résidents français, partis en Afghanistan ont été condamnés postérieurement à leur retour du djihad, pour des faits distincts de terrorisme ; le tout nouveau ministre de la Justice, E. Dupont-Moretti, plaide pour le rapatriement des terroristes détenus en Syrie et Irak !
 
Pire encore, les 40% de djihadistes qui n’ont pas récidivé ou dont il n’a pas été possible de le prouver, n’ont, en général, pas abandonné le combat et deviennent des référents religieux pour les jeunes, autrement dit des recruteurs !
 
E. Dupond-Moretti, au prétexte fallacieux que ces djihadistes sont français, souhaite donc les rapatrier pour qu’ils puissent être jugés en France, qu’ils puissent purger leur peine tout en continuant de recruter au sein du milieu pénitentiaire et pour qu’ils puissent ensuite récidiver sur notre sol !
 
L’aveuglement dogmatique dont fait preuve le Garde des Sceaux démontrent, s’il en est encore besoin, la totale déconnection de celui qui se fait applaudir comme une rock star par les délinquants dans les prisons ceci en plus de la faillite du pacte républicain.
 
Avec un tel ministre de la justice, la France et les Français ne sont pas prêts de se sentir en sécurité face au terrorisme islamiste, ceci sans compter sur les 645 prochaines libérations de détenus terroristes ou radicalisés !

President Buhari has serially, deceitfully and masterfully completed the reconfiguration of the entire National Security structure/architecture firmly in the hands of the Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani alone to the exclusion of all other ethnic blocs in Nigeria

Chief of Army Staff ....... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Police IG ........... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Minister for Defence ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Minister for Internal Affairs ...... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
National Security Adviser (NSA) ......... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
DG, Department of State Services (DSS) ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Chief of Staff ...... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
ADC to President ....... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
CSO to President ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Protocol to President ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Private Secretary to President ....... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
DG Customs .......... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
DG, EFCC ....... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
DG, Nigeria Prisons ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
DG, Immigration ...... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Minister for Petroleum ...... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani

ADD TO THESE:
1. Head of National Assembly/Senate President ...... Northern Muslim
2. Head of Judiciary/Chief Justice of Nigeria ..... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
3. Head, Federal Courts of Appeal ...... Northern Muslim Hausa-Fulani
Can this be true? Yes its true.
Yet some people will not see anything bad with this arrangement and development. The intention of Mr President towards Nigerians is really manifesting in the lopsided appointments, the hegemonistic and mediaeval chauvinistic colonialism and Fulanization of Nigeria.

Engineer Arthur Eze, we know that you're a philanthropist, but it's very wrong for you to criticize your own tribe, you said Igbos don't love each other, your first contract was awarded to you by Chief Jim Nwobodo for the construction of ABS, an Igbo man he also took you to Abubakar Rimi of Kano state, through his recommendation you secured another contract of building Kano state Radio house, Andy Uba brought Ngige and made him Governor of Anambra State, restored Peter Obi's mandate, brought Prof Dora Akunyiri to NAFDAC and Information minister, the same Andy Uba an Igbo man took you to Obasanjo, where you secured contract of servicing oil pipeline, Dr Maduka an Igbo man from Orumba transformed his town to a city built over 150 house to homeless people.

Air Peace owner Me Allen Onyema an Igbo man evacuated stranded Nigerians from South Africa (mostly Igbos) and repeating it again from UK, an Igbo man was used as collateral in Pakistan by his cousin, some group of Igbo people contributes and brought him out of death sentence. 

Yoruba people strangled Funsho Williams to death, Bola Ige was killed by his people, where is love among them. Hausa, Boko Haram and Fulani herders are killing their tribe, President refused court order to release El-Zakky and Dasuki, his tribe, governor Ganduje dethroned Emir Sanusi and chased him out of his state origin, where is love among them. Igbos remains the most peaceful and lovely tribe in Nigeria forget about your personal interest.

A reminder that you are also a renowned land grabber and your case with Chimamada Adichie's village is still in court after you tried grabbing their village land.

In a time that Senator Ifeanyi Ubah and others are fighting to remove Police road blocks here in Igboland and chase them back to the Barracks, all you could do is to request for Zone 13 to be suited in Anambra for your own interest to use it against those who oppose your land grabbing.

 What have you done to Ukpo people? The road from Onitsha to Awka which passed through Ukpo is an eyesore and the Ukpo area is the worst. If you love your people just as the Northerners love their selves, why didn't you use your political connection to get the road fixed.

Anyway, am from Arochukwu Kingdom and where I come from, we don't respect money or title, we respect integrity, humbleness and one with the fear of his Chi. Reason we don't give people chieftaincy title in the Kingdom but just awards.

This building below is not in America or Japan, it was built by your mate Dr Maduka in Umuchukwu Orumba South, Dr Maduka also built over 150 houses for the poor in his village.

ONE NIGERIA 🇳🇬 IS A BIG SCAM!!!

Allen Onyema CEO of Airpeace Airline evacuated Nigerians free of  Charge from South Africa 🌍 the same evacuation even Nigeria 🇳🇬 government are charging people during this Pandemic... 🤔

Alex Onyema volunteered his Aircraft to fly in Chinese Doctors with their Covid-19 aid to Nigeria 🇳🇬 which made history first time in Nigeria Aviation passenger flight will take off in Nigeria 🇳🇬 and land in China 🇨🇳 and return back directly to Nigeria 🇳🇬 too....

Now its time for business and Nigeria 🇳🇬 government chose Emirate Airline that charged Nigerians in UAE 🇦🇪 x2 which is #280000 for economy class and #560000 for business class for one way trip back home 🏡 in the name of evacuation....

At the same time Nigeria 🇳🇬 government is negotiating with Ethiopian Airline to evacuate Nigerians from China 🇨🇳 the same country Airpeace voluntary donated its Aircraft to receive aid for Nigerian government... 🤔 🤔

The hatred this present government have on Igbos are so visible... Why on earth will you negotiate with other foreign companies to do business at a higher rate when you have indigenous company at a cheaper rate with a reliable service???

Will you tell me that this same thing will happen if Airpeace belongs to Dangote???

Airpeace Airline started international flights to UAE 🇦🇪 with two brand New Boeing 777 world best Aircraft makers and taking delivery of 13 brand new Aircraft this month making it 15 brand new Aircraft on their fleet... This is to show you they are capable of flying ✈ all Nigerians in at any capacity.... 🤔

This same government started their scam campaign of buy Nigeria to grow Naira but they are buying foreign to wreck naira because of their hatred on Igbos... 🤔

The more you hate Igbos in business aspects the more you wreck Nigeria economy because Nigeria economy has never and will never survive without the Igbos... #IGBO means business and you can't hate business and have flourishing economy...

63667,"🖋 « Prisons, le grand déconfinement, y compris pour les détenus radicalisés ! » | Retrouvez mon communiqué ⤵️
 
 
Alors que l’objectif, déjà scandaleux, de la Ministre de la Justice était de libérer 5.000 détenus pour de prétendues raisons sanitaires, on apprend qu’entre le 16 mars et le 1er avril, ce sont plus de 6.266 détenus qui ont été remis en liberté !
 
Dans le même temps, on peut lire dans la presse régionale que de nombreux délits ont été récemment commis par des détenus fraîchement libérés tels que la violente agression avec arme d’une femme médecin à Villeurbanne par un suspect, âgé de 22 ans, qui comptabilise 60 inscriptions sur son casier judiciaire et qui a été remis en liberté le 24 mars dernier !
 
Pire encore, alors que 43 détenus condamnés pour des faits de terrorisme doivent être libérés cette année et qu'une soixantaine devrait l’être en 2021, on apprend aujourd’hui que 130 détenus radicalisés, dont la dangerosité n’est plus à démontrer, vont être remis en liberté pour raison sanitaire, d’après les services de renseignements.
 
Alors que les Français sont confinés, des milliers de détenus sont donc libérés et, parmi eux, potentiellement les plus dangereux. Daesh a, en effet, intimé l'ordre à ses ""soldats"" de profiter de cette sombre période de pandémie pour multiplier les attentats et répandre la terreur sur notre sol, la tuerie de samedi dernier à Romans-sur-Isère nous le rappelle cruellement.
 
Faire courir de tels risques supplémentaires à notre population, déjà confrontée à une crise majeure, relève d'une totale irresponsabilité doublée d'une mise en danger caractérisée au sens pénal du terme !

« Depuis quatre jours, l’Europe doit faire face à un risque majeur d’une nouvelle crise migratoire encouragée par le gouvernement islamiste d’Ankara.

Cette politique du chantage, de la menace et de la déstabilisation menée par Erdogan n’est plus acceptable, pas plus que cette tentative de tordre le bras aux pays européens pour les contraindre à intervenir dans le conflit syrien et dans les guerres d’occupation territoriale que mène depuis trois ans la Turquie dans ce pays.

Offensives violentes contre les kurdes de Syrie, soutiens à certains groupes djihadistes comme l’ont révélé les observateurs internationaux, l’intervention turque en Syrie a contribué à accentuer la déstabilisation de cette région et à aggraver la situation humanitaire.

A l’heure où des dizaines de milliers de migrants sont encouragés par Ankara à franchir les frontières européennes, l’urgence commande, aux côtés de la poursuite des négociations, à tout entreprendre pour pallier l’impuissance de l’Union européenne face au péril migratoire.

Dans un premier temps, le recouvrement des frontières nationales par le biais du mécanisme du contrôle temporaire en cas de crise doit être engagé par les autorités françaises.

Il est par ailleurs urgent, au regard de ce nouveau fiasco de Frontex qui n’a pas su anticiper cette crise, (depuis plus d’un an, la Grèce se débat seule et doit faire face à un afflux ininterrompu de migrants en provenance des côtes turques, plus de 70 000 à ce jour), de soulever la question de l’inefficacité du contrôle des frontières extérieures de l’Europe.

La protection des territoires nationaux et l’anticipation des crises migratoires qui se multiplient, passent par le retour aux frontières nationales et à leur contrôle permanent.

Enfin, au vu de la duplicité, des alliances douteuses et des dérives inquiétantes et bellicistes du régime d’Erdogan, il appartient à l’Union européenne de reconsidérer ses relations avec Ankara et de mettre fin immédiatement aux coûteuses négociations d’adhésion tout autant qu’au désormais caduque accord de 2016, censé juguler les flux migratoires. »",0.200795,0.023076924,0.191015,0.04291453,0.010343489,0.10221587
